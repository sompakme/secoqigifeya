I didn’t know what to expect when I was gonna run into Jamie Lynn, you know, and found myself just sitting with her and, and we would talk and laugh and giggle. When I came into the show, my baby was 3 months old and hers [daughter <a href=#>Ivey</a>, now 3] was about a year and so she was understanding me, you know, <a href=#>breast-feeding in the trailer and pumping</a>. And so, she’d be like, ‘Just do this and get this and get this for that.’ … But it was great to have, you know, that [advice] from her.”</p><p class=p1>Season 2 of the Netflix drama picked up where its first season — which premiered in May 2020 — left off as <a href=#>viewers learned who was involved in a terrifying car accident</a> alongside Maddie’s son Kyle Townsend (<strong>Logan Allen</strong>).
