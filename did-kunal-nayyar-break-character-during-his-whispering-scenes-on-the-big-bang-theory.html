However, according to Kunal, <a href=#>he was sticking to the script given how little time they had to shoot.</a></p><p>He said, "I don't -- our tapings are so tight, we have it down to a real science. Plus, a lot of the language on the show is so specific that if you change a word it will mess up the whole speech rhythm.
