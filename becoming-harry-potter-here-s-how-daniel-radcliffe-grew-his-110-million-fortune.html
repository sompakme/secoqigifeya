The actor was eleven when he bagged the role of a lifetime as Harry Potter in the <i>Harry Potter</i> series, which was derived from the book written <a href=#>by JK Rowling</a>. The first film was a smashing hit at the box office, and Radcliffe played the character for ten years until 2011. Along with working in the popular movie series, he has also shown his talent in television shows, plays, and Broadway performances that have increased his fortune to $110 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has been ten years since <i>Harry Potter</i> ended, but it remains his most popular and highest-paying role to date, which has earned him millions. Here are some other ways that helped him grow an empire of $110 million.</p><h2 id=the-boy-who-lived>The Boy Who Lived</h2><p>Daniel passed up his first acting opportunity to star in the television production of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, adapted from Charles Dickens’ novel of the same title. In 1999 he was cast in the lead role in the BBC miniseries <i>David Copperfield</i>, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>. After Harry Potter became one of the highest-selling book series of all time, Warner Bros. bought the rights to adapt it into a movie from author J.K. Rowling. Director Chris Columbus, best known for his movies <i>Home Alone</i>, <i>Night At The Museum</i>, and <i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i>, was chosen to direct the first two movies. After the director saw Radcliffe in <i>David Copperfield</i>, he was asked to audition for the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Net Worth Of The Cast Of Harry Potter</a></span></p><p>The young actor was hesitant to accept the role after it was offered since the first two movies were to be shot in Los Angeles. The studios relocated their set to England to accommodate him and his family. At eleven, he became a millionaire as he made $1 million in salary from his acting role in the first movie in the series <a href=#><i>Harry Potter And The Philosopher’s Stone</i></a>. The movie grossed over $1.02 billion at the box office worldwide, ensuring possible future sequels.</p><p>Radcliffe saw a hike in his earnings for future movies as they continued to dominate in theaters worldwide. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Parade</a>, he was paid $3 million for the second film <i>Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets</i>, and $6 million for <i>Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban</i>. For <i>Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire</i>, he earned $11 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=theater-broadway-and-movies>Theater, Broadway, and Movies</h2><p>Along with starring in the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies, Daniel Radcliffe also landed roles in other movies and productions. In 2001 he starred opposite Pierce Brosnan in <i>The Tailor Of Panama</i> and made his stage debut in 2002 in the West End production of <i>The Play What I Wrote</i>. 2006 was a big year for Radcliffe, who bagged the lead role in <i>Equus</i> by Peter Shaffer. The play revived the original 1973 run, where the actor was cast as the lead, Alan Strang. His performance as a stable boy obsessed with horses showed the star of <i>Harry Potter</i> in a different light. The theater production generated over $2 million in advanced sales, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. In 2007, he starred in <i>December Boys</i> and <i>My Boy Jack</i>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He returned to the world of Hogwarts as Harry Potter for the fifth installment of the series called <i>Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix</i>, which made over $942 million worldwide and earned him a $14 million paycheck. The next movie, <i>Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince</i>, paid him $24 million and collected $934 million at the box office. The last book by J.K Rowling, <i>Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows</i> was divided into two parts for release: <i>Deathly Hallows Part 1 </i>and <i>Deathly Hallows Part 2</i>. <a href=#>The actor made a whopping $50 million for the two-part movies</a>.</p><h2 id=projects-after-harry-potter>Projects After <i>Harry Potter</i></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The year <i>Harry Potter</i> ended, Daniel Radcliffe made his musical Broadway debut with <i>How To Be Successful Without Really Trying</i> and played the lead role of J. Pierrepont. His performance earned him positive reviews from critics. In addition to making more than $90 million in salary from the <i>Harry Potter</i> series, Radcliffe has chosen careful projects without the obligation to cash big paychecks.
