Cancer-schmancer!’ she said.</p><p>Admitting the depression it had sunk her into she said, ‘In the beginning I was in just a state of numbness. I just walked around just feeling numb. I was afraid for my children. They were very, very upset. Then I went through a period that I wouldn’t be attractive to my fiance. I thought, “I’ll just remove them (my breasts)…”<br>She however said that her husband greatly supported her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=janice-dickinson-book></span><span>Janice Dickinson Book</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World’s First Supermodel</li><li>Everything About Me Is Fake– And I’m Perfect Paperback</li><li>Check, Please!: Dating, Mating, and Extricating Paperback</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=janice-dickinson-model-janice-dickinson-80s></span><span>Janice Dickinson Model |&nbsp;Janice Dickinson 80s</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dickinson moved to New York City to pursue work as a model, in the early 1970s, after winning a national competition called “Miss High Fashion Model.” Dickinson was turned down several times by modeling agents, including Eileen Ford, who informed Dickinson she was “much too ethnic. You’ll never work.” This is because it was at a time when blue-eyed blondes dominated the fashion scene.</p><p>She was discovered by the fashion photographer Jacques Silberstein when his girlfriend, actress Lorraine Bracco, mentioned she liked Dickinson’s look. Wilhelmina Cooper became Dickinson’s first agent. Her modeling pursuits led her to Paris, France, where her “exotic looks” secured her reputation within the European fashion industry. She returned to New York City in 1978, and spent the next several years working steadily, earning $2,000 per day, nearly four times the standard rate.</p><p>She eventually signed with Ford Models to land a major ad campaign for a new JVC camera. She however had not forgotten Ford’s initial rejection, and was intent on revenge. She defected together with other models to John Casablancas’s upstart Elite Model Management.</p><p>By the 1980s, She was considered a supermodel, as she “possessed the kind of name and face recognition” that the majority of women in the modeling industry strive to achieve. She appeared within and on covers of magazines including Harper’s Bazaar, Cosmopolitan, Photo, Vogue, Marie Claire, and Playboy, and worked with some of fashion’s best-known names, including Bill Blass, Gianni Versace, Valentino Garavani, Azzedine Alaïa, Pino Lancetti, Halston, Oscar de la Renta and Calvin Klein.</p><p>She has appeared on the cover of Vogue for a total of 37 times. She also appeared on the cover of Elle seven times in a row and has been the face of ad campaigns for brands including Revlon, Alberto VO5, Balmain, Obao, Christian Dior, Clairol, Hush Puppies, Orbit gum, Max Factor, Virginia Slims, and Cutex. As a way to sustain her relevance within the fashion industry as she aged, she became a fashion photographer.</p><p>In 2008, she launched her own jewelry line on HSN. She recorded a song entitled “Crazy”, In 2009, which was written and produced by Craig Taylor. While she claims to have coined the term supermodel in 1979, and to be the first “supermodel”, the word already was known in the 1940s. The writer Judith Cass used the term in 1942 in her Chicago Tribune article “Super Models are Signed for Fashion Show”. In 1943, author Clyde Matthew Dessner used the term in his book So You Want to Be a Model!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fn66vtcKeZJ2hk6C2r7%2FOp2SboZ%2Bcv6K8x7Jkmp%2BVYrOiucilsGaroKTCtLGMm6memaOpeqStzZycq2WSpLysv4yapZ1lnaSxpriO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-denton-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>James Denton Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
