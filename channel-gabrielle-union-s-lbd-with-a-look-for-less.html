Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade are relationship goals. The ageless actress and the former basketball player are the ultimate power couple, ruling the red carpet and the court. And as Hollywood royalty, they know that less is more when it comes to fashion.
On Sunday, August 6, the pair showed up to FRWD’s Hall of Fame party honoring Wade in two classic ensembles: Union in a black mini dress and her hubby in a white tank and black trousers."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Simple yet stylish!</p><p>Union’s LBD deserves an induction into the Hall of Fame for fashion! The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Coperni bustier cocktail dress from FWRD</a> features a sweetheart neckline and side pockets. Styled by <strong>Thomas Christos Kikis</strong> (Wade was styled by <strong>Jason Bolden</strong>, of Netflix’s Styling Hollywood and Next in Fashion fame), the Bring It On star teamed her look with black accessories and Tiffany & Co. jewelry. A little black dress will never go out of style! But since aren’t trying to splurge on Union’s $1,000 frock, we found an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">affordable alternative from Amazon</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shutterstock_editorial_14044012bd.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LINJOU Satin Sweetheart Neckline Wrap Bodycon Corset Mini Dress</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$37</a> (originally $51) at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, August 8, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">satin mini dress</a> is very similar to Union’s LBD — but we may even prefer this one more! The ruched wrap silhouette adds tummy control that snatches your stomach and lifts your booty. No lumps or bumps here! And while Union pulls off her frock’s plunging neckline, we feel more comfortable with this corset top that still provides ample cleavage. This dress is perfect for date night or girls’ night!</p><p>Still on the hunt for a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">little black dress </a>that suits your fancy? We rounded up seven other options (all under $45 from Amazon) that are bound to become closet staples!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shutterstock_editorial_14044012al.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LINJOU Satin Sweetheart Neckline Wrap Bodycon Corset Mini Dress</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$37</a> (originally $51) at Amazon!
