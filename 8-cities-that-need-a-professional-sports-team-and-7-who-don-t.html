There are some truly awesome cities with not enough or no sports teams at all, and there are some not so awesome cities with too many teams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB</a> all continue to grow year after year. Along with that&nbsp;growth sometimes comes expansion. While the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL already has 32 teams</a> and the NHL is on their way to 32 with a team starting in Seattle in 2021, the NBA and MLB are still stuck at 30.</p><p>There aren't many reasons as to why all four major sports could get up to 34 or 35 teams in the next 10-15 years, especially considering the amount of awesome cities that are dying to get a major sports team.</p><p>Let's take a look at some of the major cities that need a sports team and some of the cities that have teams, but shouldn't.</p><h2 id=need-vancouver---nba-team><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Need: Vancouver - NBA Team</span></h2><p>Vancouver is an absolutely beautiful city. They&nbsp;had the Grizzlies from 1995-2001 but that is hardly enough time for a franchise to establish a fan base. They have proven to have loyal fans with the Vancouver Canucks and even the Vancouver Whitecaps... it's time to get an NBA team back in Vancouver.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-t-chicago---two-baseball-teams><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Don't: Chicago - Two Baseball Teams</span></h2><p>Chicago is obviously an awesome city but they already have the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bears, Bulls, Blackhawks and Cubs</a>... they don't need the White Sox. Are there actually any Chicago White Sox fans? Either way, there are a lot of awesome cities that could use a baseball team and quite simply, Chicago doesn't need two.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED LINK:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Bulls Dynasty: 15 Pics Of The Team’s Transformation</a></span></p><h2 id=need-seattle---an-nba-team-again><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Need: Seattle - An NBA Team... Again</span></h2><p>It's a tragedy that Seattle no longer has a basketball team, especially because fans so desperately want one. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It's nice that they're getting an NHL team</a>&nbsp;but they've proven in the past that Seattle loves its hoops. If the NHL can expand to 32 teams, the NBA certainly could do the same over the next few years.</p><h2 id=don-t-orlando---another-nba-team><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Don't: Orlando - Another NBA Team</span></h2><p>Potentially a controversial one, but the Orlando Magic are a perpetually irrelevant NBA team. Current Orlando Magic fans, of which there are few, would likely have no problem hopping over and cheering for the Miami Heat, a much better franchise currently and historically.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED LINK:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 NBA Teams That’ll Destroy The Toronto Raptors This Season</a></span></p><h2 id=need-toronto---an-nfl-team><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Need: Toronto - An NFL Team</span></h2><p>Toronto is not only one of the best cities in North America, it's one of the best cities in the world. They've proven to have a devoted fan base for the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Toronto Raptors regardless of the team's record. It's time for Torontonians to stop cheering for the Buffalo Bills and to get their own NFL team.</p><h2 id=don-t-los-angeles---nfl-team><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Don't: Los Angeles - NFL Team</span></h2><p>The Chargers just recently moved to Los Angeles and there's still no reason why it should have happened. The Chargers had a devoted fan base in San Diego and now have absolutely nothing going for them in LA. Los Angeles is a basketball city but if they're going to watch football they'd likely be more inclined to watch the Rams.</p><h2 id=need-mexico-city---nfl-or-nba-team><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Need: Mexico City - NFL Or NBA Team</span></h2><p>This is an interesting idea that has been floated around by the NFL most notably. The NBA already has a team in Canada so it wouldn't be that big of a stretch to add a team in Mexico. This would be somewhat of an experiment, but it could be a really interesting one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-t-florida---another-nhl-team><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Don't: Florida - Another NHL Team</span></h2><p>The answer is no. The Tampa Bay Lightning are fine, at least they're a good team but the Florida Panthers have literally never been good. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Panthers have only made the playoffs 5 times</a> in their 25 years as a franchise and have only made it past the first round once.&nbsp;Just move them.</p><h2 id=need-utah---mlb-team><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Need: Utah - MLB Team</span></h2><p>Salt Lake City needs more sports teams, starting with an MLB team. They already have awesome NBA and MLS fans and the fans of their college teams always show out. There is no reason why you couldn't add an MLB team to the mix. There could almost guarantee that there would be fans at the games, which is the least you can ask for.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED LINK:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things We Didn’t Realize Went On Behind The Scenes During The NBA Season</a></span></p><h2 id=don-t-san-diego---mlb-team><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Don't: San Diego - MLB Team</span></h2><p>San Diego already lost the Chargers so it would be somewhat cruel to also take their MLB team from them but there are just so many better cities. The aforementioned Salt Lake City could be an awesome spot for the Padres and would bring in a whole new crop of young MLB fans. Padres fans could easily cheer for the Angels, Dodgers or Giants... they have endless options.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=need-montreal---mlb-team><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Need: Montreal - MLB Team</span></h2><p>This is another one, similar to Seattle, that is a no-brainer. Montreal is starving for baseball and they need a team again. They already have a ravenous fanbase when it comes to hockey and the fans that formerly cheered for the Montreal Expos would be thrilled if their team came back into their lives.</p><h2 id=don-t-pheonix---nhl-team><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Don't: Pheonix - NHL Team</span></h2><p>The Coyotes, similar to the Florida Panthers, have been bad for essentially the entire existence of their franchise. They used to be the Phoenix Coyotes and for some reason, they thought that if they changed their name to the Arizona Coyotes that would help? There are just so many better options for an NHL team than Phoenix.</p><h2 id=need-oklahoma---mlb-or-nfl-team><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Need: Oklahoma - MLB Or NFL Team</span></h2><p>Oklahoma City has a rabid fan base for all their college teams and their NBA team. They're a growing city that has proven that they can maintain the fan base of a professional sports team. An NFL or MLB team seems like it would make a lot of sense in Oklahoma City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=don-t-charlotte---nba-team><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Don't: Charlotte - NBA Team</span></h2><p>Charlotte is a beautiful city, but they have never had a good NBA team. While it's unlikely that Michael Jordan would ever sell the team, he could move it. There are a lot of cities that would love to have an NBA team and considering Michael Jordan's well know love for gambling, this next city might make a lot of sense for him to take the Hornets.</p><h2 id=need-las-vegas---an-nba-team><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Need: Las Vegas - An NBA Team</span></h2><p>Ah yes, Las Vegas. One of the best cities in the world at providing world-class entertainment. They recently got an NHL team and an NFL team, the NBA has already been experimenting with a WNBA team there so it makes perfect sense to add an NBA team in Las Vegas. Especially if the aforementioned Michael Jordan wants to move his Charlotte Hornets there.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT LINK:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Star Players Who Absolutely Hated Their Coaches</a></span></p><p><strong class=punchline-small>Sources: Wikipedia, NHL.com, champsorchumps.us</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhvZpuZqbamv4ytn5qsXaOyprCMmmSpqp%2BbsrS%2FyKilmqRdqL2wvtOsZK2dkaJ6orrDZm5mr5ikeqW7za1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-cars-that-can-park-themselves-better-than-you.html><span>←</span><span>15 Cars That Can Park Themselves Better Than You</span></a>
