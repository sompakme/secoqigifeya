With hit songs like ‘Say My Name’, ‘Survivor’ and ‘Charlie’s Angels’, Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams were well on their way to superstardom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was just a rapper out of Brooklyn, New York, fast rising through the ranks as a formidable lyricist talking about his ‘Hard Knock Life.’ Sean Corey Carter was his government name, but everybody knew him as Jay-Z.</p><p>Then they got together and did Bonnie and Clyde,&nbsp;something began to stir in people’s hearts. Though the world was flurry with speculation, after the song Crazy In Love, they remained adamant that they were just friends. That was, until the day when the bomb dropped- when the queen Bey announced she had found her king! The King of rap-Jay-Z!! The beyhive was abuzz!</p><p>From their days of ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ to ‘Legacy’ and celebrating their 10th year marriage anniversary, little can be said that could take away the fact that they are the ‘it’ couple in entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of this, they have been placed on a pedestal and their lives, in spite of their efforts, have been shoved into the limelight with literally everyone having a scoop on everything that goes on in their lives. From Jay-z’s alleged unfaithfulness, to his altercation with Solange down to the birth of their children Blue Ivy, Sir and Rumi.</p><p>As they celebrate their 10 years of highs and lows, let’s take a look back at some of the moments that made them a force that caused ripples throughout the globe.</p><h2 id=bonnie-and-clyde><strong>Bonnie and Clyde</strong></h2><p>From being just friends and blossoming into music’s power couple, Jay-Z and Beyoncé have always been each other’s ride or die. They met when Beyoncé was <a href=#>just 18 years old</a> and officially started dating in 2003.</p><p>Even though it was evident to all- always being in each other’s company, attending every award and show together, down to the way Jay looked at her, they still insisted that they were just ‘good friends.’ When the news finally broke that they were going steady, it&nbsp;was like everybody was at the destination before they arrived. Even then, they kept their private lives secret from the prying public eyes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-secret-wedding><strong>Their Secret Wedding</strong></h2><p>A decade ago, On April 4 2008, in New York City, after about 5 years of dating, music’s hottest couple Jay-Z and Beyoncé, got married in a super-secret ceremony in front of 40 close friends and family.</p><p>So secret was this ceremony that there are no official media photos or images in existence. The only ones we have, are the ones we are made privy to by the Carters and those leaked by those who attended the ceremony. Like when Beyoncé’s mum leaked one during their 9-year anniversary. Jay looked dashing in a black tux while the queen donned a voluminous white gown.</p><h2 id=brooklyn-s-finest><strong>Brooklyn’s Finest</strong></h2><p>Basketball seems to be every rapper’s sport of choice, and Jay-Z and Beyoncé are no different. Jay-Z was the first rapper to ever be a part owner of an NBA team. This New York native bought a stake of the Nets in January 2004, and was one of the reasons the team changed locations from New Jersey to Brooklyn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although he recently <a href=#>sold his shares</a> in the team, he stated in an interview with MTV that he will be a “Net fan forever.” Jay-Z is still involved with the Nets, however, as he owns a share of the Barclays Center and will be seated courtside for the majority of the regular season. Here, we see him at the Nets vs New York Knicks game on November 26 2012, at Barclays Center.</p><h2 id=we-fly-high><strong>We Fly High</strong></h2><p>From their days of being ‘just friends’ to after they got married, Jay-Z and Beyoncé have set themselves way above everybody else; not just in music but also as a <a href=#>power couple</a>. They embody everything a hip-hop power couple should have- vastly disproportionate wealth, a swarm of faithful fans and followers, consecutive mega hits, an image that everybody else seeks to emulate and a lifestyle that sets them apart from the mold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From their carefully handpicked inner circle, to vacating at the most beautiful places in the world, these two have made sure that everything in and about them is just a cut above everybody else.</p><h2 id=drunk-in-love><strong>Drunk In Love</strong></h2><p>Hiccups in their marriage aside, it is no secret that Jay-Z and Beyoncé are crazy in love. Their ‘Mr. Carter’ and ‘Mrs. Carter’ T-shirts and <a href=#>matching outfits</a> see to it. They do it so well you would be tempted to think it is rehearsed.</p><p>Then you see that look in Jay-Z’s eyes; the chemistry that we see in the hot music videos for <a href=#>Partition</a> and <a href=#>Drunk In Love</a> and how he unconsciously stares at her while she is slaying on the red carpet and you will get different ideas. Their incessant <a href=#>public display of affection</a> all but confirm what we already know. If that is not love, I have no idea what is.</p><h2 id=strutting-the-red-carpet><strong>Strutting The Red Carpet</strong></h2><p>One of the top requirements for any celebrity of any status, whether A or D-lister, is to slay on the red carpet. Many things are forgivable, but a wardrobe malfunction on the red carpet, any red carpet for that matter, cannot be pardoned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, our power couple know this all too well, and have never disappointed on any carpet whatsoever. Whether it’s at the <a href=#>Grammy’s</a> or at <a href=#>Rihanna’s annual Diamond Ball</a>, Jay and Bey strut their stuff like the pro-ballers that they are, wowing us with every outfit; like they knew what we wanted, before we knew we wanted it. Take Beyoncé’s Givenchy Haute Couture by Riccardo Tisci Tulle and Stone which she wore at the <a href=#>2015 Met Gala Institute Ball</a>, she stunned the entire crowd, including her husband.</p><h2 id=good-music><strong>Good Music</strong></h2><p>If there is one thing that these two juggernauts know how to do, it is <a href=#>making good music</a>. Beyoncé and Jay-Z have combined their unique style and blend to make what can only be termed as Grammy worthy music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Bonnie and Clyde, to Crazy in Love to Upgrade You to Déjà Vu to Drunk in Love to Family Feud; need I go on? There is just something special that happens when these two come together to make a record. His unique lyrical prowess and her powerful vocals have combined time and time again to produce club bangers and songs that we believe will be immortalized long after they are gone.</p><h2 id=spell-binding-performances><strong>Spell Binding Performances</strong></h2><p>What is it about Jay-Z and Beyoncé on stage that captures not just your mind but your very soul? Over the years we have seen them collab with other artists and even share the stage with them but there is just something about the two of them…together.</p><p>Whether it’s at the Grammy’s, <a href=#>BET</a>, MTV Video Music Awards or even <a href=#>the Global Citizen Fest</a>, this duo has treated us to a spectacle of performances that has us going back to watch and re-watch it just so we can be electrified one more time. The music, the chemistry, the choreography, the lights, the atmosphere. Brilliant! Simply, brilliant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=on-the-run-tour><strong>On The Run Tour</strong></h2><p>On March 12 2014, it was announced that Beyoncé and Jay-Z were going on tour together. This tour, dubbed the ‘On the Run Tour’ was a co-headlining stadium tour that came shortly after the two had finished their own solo tours — Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, and Jay-Z's Magna Carter World Tour (both 2013–2014).</p><p>The tour ran from 25 June to 13 September 2014, holding 19 shows in North America and two in Europe, with a total attendance of 979,781 loyal fans, raking in a box office revenue of 109 million USD.</p><h2 id=forever-young-halo-performance-on-the-run-tour><strong>Forever Young/Halo Performance-On The Run Tour</strong></h2><p>On The Run tour sums up what an electrifying performance from a celebrity couple should be. One particular moment during this tour was when it stopped off in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>After rocking the crowd to the brim, Jay and Beyoncé closed off the show by mashing up their songs Halo and Forever Young into one of the <a href=#>most magical live performances</a> of all time. Lights went off in the Gillette stadium and cellphone lights went on. Jay and Bey then went on to perform their two songs while backed by a video showcasing some precious moments including their wedding, the birth of Blue Ivy and the safari they took to the Serengeti.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blue-ivy-carter><strong>Blue Ivy Carter</strong></h2><p>On 7 January 2012, Jay-Z and Beyoncé welcomed into the world a beautiful little girl. They named her <a href=#>Blue Ivy Carter</a>; with her middle name paying homage to the couple’s favorite number, 4. (Beyoncé was born on 4th September while Jay-z was born on 4th December and both got married on 4th April 2008.)</p><p>The first born daughter of the most famous couple in the world, Blue Ivy, was shoved into the limelight even before she could fully open her eyes, with media houses craning to have a glimpse of the heir to the music throne. At only 6 years old, she is currently the coolest little girl on the planet.</p><h2 id=the-perfect-family><strong>The Perfect Family</strong></h2><p>Each time somebody takes a look at <a href=#>Jay-Z, Beyoncé</a> and Blue Ivy, they cannot not help but feel a pang of jealousy well up in them at what they see. These three <a href=#>portray what everybody wish their family could look like</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The gentle manner in which Jay handles Blue Ivy and the twins, Sir and Rumi, and the loving way in which Beyoncé reveres him would just warm your heart towards them. This picture, taken at the 66th NBA All-Star Game at Smoothie King Center on Feb 19 2017 in New Orleans, was just an indication of how much love and genuine care there is in the Carter household- the portrait of a perfect family.</p><h2 id=lemonade><strong>Lemonade</strong></h2><p>On April 23 2016, Beyoncé released her 6th studio album dubbed ‘Lemonade’. This album was greatly significant due to the lightly veiled messaging in the songs and videos that, for the first time, revealed to the world that all was not rosy in the Carter household.</p><p>It was in this album that she detailed his alleged&nbsp;straying ways albeit without actually saying his name or the names of the women. Talk about secrecy even in the midst of confession! It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was the highest selling individual album globally in the year 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=becky-with-the-good-hair><strong>“Becky With The Good Hair”</strong></h2><p>No marriage is devoid of challenges, and being a billionaire power couple does not in any way exempt you from the low moments of marriage. “Better call <a href=#>Becky with the good hair</a>” was a line Beyoncé used in her song ‘Sorry’ off the album Lemonade, and it shone light on the speculations that had been rife for quite a while that Jay-Z had strayed.</p><p>Allegations had been circulating about his alleged involvement with Rita Ora, Rachel Roy and Blu Cantrell. Though never officially confirmed by the two, subtle messaging that is found in their songs indicate to the fact that the infidelity did occur.</p><h2 id=solange-s-elevator-moment><strong>Solange’s Elevator&nbsp;moment</strong></h2><p>#ElevatorRage. That was the hash tag that was trending on the morning following the 2014 Met Gala after party. The phrase was coined after <a href=#>a video went viral</a> in which Solange Knowles, little sister to Beyoncé, was seen getting into a confrontation with Jay-Z in an elevator while her sister stood by and watched.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The footage showed Solange wildly yelling at Jay before hitting and kicking him while a security personnel tried to restrain her. At some point in the video, Beyoncé tried to get in between her husband and sister.</p><h2 id=i-got-a-set-of-twins><strong>“I Got A Set Of Twins”</strong></h2><p>On February 1st 2017, Beyoncé literally <a href=#>broke the internet</a> when she announced that she was expectant with twins, specifically, fraternal twins. Four months later, on June 13, at 5:12 a.m. Sir and Rumi Carter were ushered into this world and they have been a hit ever since.</p><p>For so long, there&nbsp;were no official photos of the duo, except speculative shots snapped from what looked like a million miles away, until their mother <a href=#>‘introduced’</a> them via a carefully orchestrated Instagram post in which she debuted the duo though their faces were not shown. Nobody actually saw the duo till November of last year when the family was <a href=#>spotted in Miami</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-44><strong>4:44</strong></h2><p>4:44 is Jay-Z’s 13th studio album and was released on June 30 2017, barely a year after Beyoncé had released her much anticipated album ‘Lemonade’ and a few weeks after the birth of Sir and Rumi. Just like Usher Raymond did with ‘Confessions’, 4:44 was Jay-Z coming clean about his sins and seeking penance. He did little to hide this in the song 4:44, where he confesses to being unfaithful and apologizes to Beyoncé.</p><p>However, still no names are mentioned as the Carters maintain their mold of secrecy. He also opens up about his insecurities and his relationship with his dad. The album went platinum within a week after release.</p><h2 id=blue-ivy-being-just-as-cool><strong>Blue Ivy&nbsp;being just as cool</strong></h2><p>Blue Ivy Carter is by far the coolest celebrity kid; and she makes cool look so easy. Being the first born daughter of a mogul dad and pop diva mum may probably not be the easiest thing to do, but she does it with such grace and bravado, it is hard to believe she is only 6 years old. She commands a massive following, has her <a href=#>own stylist and personal shopper</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When your parents are hip-hop powerhouses, it goes as an unwritten rule that you must look your best at all times, no excuses. Blue has taken this challenge head on. Just take a look at this ensemble which she wore at the Wearable Art Gala. Blue is bad and she knows it.</p><h2 id=blue-says-shush><strong>Blue Says “Shush”</strong></h2><p>During the <a href=#>2018 GRAMMYs</a>, Beyoncé and Jay-Z's adorable daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, <a href=#>stole the spotlight</a> with her <a href=#>precocious antics</a> -- such as when she politely asked her famous mom <a href=#>to stop clapping</a> while Camila Cabello was delivering a speech on stage. The six-year-old Blue Ivy Carter was caught on camera shushing Beyoncé before warning Jay-Z not to clap as well.</p><p>Blue Ivy Carter told her royal parents, Beyoncé and Jay Z, to do less when it came to clapping for presenters during the Grammys, shushing them with a subtle, professional hand gesture while Camila Cabello was speaking—and the Internet went insane.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=awards><strong>Awards</strong></h2><p>One of the indications of just how successful a musician you are, is in how many awards you manage to scoop up. Jay and Beyoncé are at the helm of this. Beyoncé has 24 <a href=#>MTV Video Music Awards</a>, making her the <a href=#>most-awarded artist</a> in the award show history. Beyoncé is also the most-awarded artist at the <a href=#>BET Awards</a> and the <a href=#>Soul Train Awards</a>.</p><p>With a total of 22 awards and 63 nominations from the <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a> for her music (as a solo artist and with <a href=#>Destiny's Child</a>), she is the most nominated woman and the second-most awarded woman in Grammy history. She has won a total of 306 awards from 847 nominations. Jay-Z has received a total of <a href=#>86 awards from 209 nominations</a>. These include 3 American Music Awards, 2 Billboard Music Awards, 21 Grammy Awards, 7 BET Awards and 8 MTV Video Music Awards. (Source: MTV)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=moguls><strong>Moguls</strong></h2><p>What’s better than one billionaire? Two. And that’s exactly what Hov and Bey have become; not just a power couple but also a <a href=#>billion-dollar couple</a>. Their combined net worth was $1.16 billion as of 18 May 2017, according to Forbes.</p><p>Beyoncé is worth $350 million and Jay Z ranks as one of the world's richest rappers, with $810 million. Jay-Z, who is the second richest person in hip-hop, following Diddy by $10 million, also owns a number of companies including Roc Nation, Rocawear, and Armand de Brignac. Both hold stakes in the music steaming service Tidal as well. They also had a great deal of success with their number one albums Lemonade and 4:44.</p><h2 id=obama-s-favorite-rapper><strong>Obama’s Favorite Rapper</strong></h2><p>This famous line, off his song On To The Next One from the album The Carter III, may have at first come out as Jay-Z being like every other rapper- bragging about associations that are probably nonexistent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, this is not the case with Jay-Z. Apart from being the 44th president’s <a href=#>favorite rapper</a>, the two were more than just acquaintances. Once, Obama was quoted saying, “Jay and I are crazy about our girls…” When Jay-Z was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Obama <a href=#>cut a promo</a> for him and actually said, “You know, you my favorite rapper.” How cute.</p><h2 id=the-26-million-east-hampton-house><strong>The $26 million East Hampton house</strong></h2><p>It is the dream of every couple to buy a home together. It is somewhat of a sign that they are growing together. Now this may not be their first house together, owning property is New York and New Orleans, but Beyoncé and Jay-Z just purchased a gorgeous $26 million <a href=#>East Hampton house</a> truly fit for a queen.</p><p>The <a href=#>12,000-square-foot estate</a> boasts of seven bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms and 203-feet of direct water space on the Georgica Pond, according to <a href=#>Trulia</a>. Designed by Stanford White, the 100-year-old house sits on an elevated two-acre site next to 17-acres of meadow preserve. Talk about strides.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=king-and-queen><strong>King and Queen</strong></h2><p>When you look at both of them, it is hard to imagine that they have been married for 10 years. This power couple are riding high on the wave of fame and fortune and it is hard to try and imagine just what heights they are destined for.</p><p>They may look like they have reached the pinnacle, but with these two, only time will tell. They are the undisputed king and queen of hip-hop, a throne that they are not about to be usurped from any time soon. They are also parents to the cutest set of kids and it is very interesting to see how they will introduce their progeny to the wealth and power they are bound to inherit.</p><h2 id=buzz-buzz-buzz---the-beyhive-says-happy-10th-anniversary><strong>Buzz Buzz Buzz - The BeyHive Says Happy 10th Anniversary!!</strong></h2><p>So as they take on this new chapter in their lives, we wish Hov and Bey just the very best.
