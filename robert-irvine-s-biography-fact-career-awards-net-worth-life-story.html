On the show, the chefs attempt to transform the country’s most hopeless cooks from kitchen zeros to kitchen heroes through a grueling culinary boot camp.</p><p>A native of England, Robert joined the British Royal Navy at the age of 15, and his skills in the kitchen soon came to the attention of his superiors. As part of his service for the Royal Navy, Robert was selected to work onboard the Royal Yacht Britannia, where the Royal Family and their entourages regularly dined. During his time spent training U.S. Navy chefs as part of a guest chef program, Robert worked in the White House kitchens, and his creations were served to high-ranking government officials. During his career, he has also had the opportunity to serve 6,000 servicemen and servicewomen on a U.S. aircraft carrier and plan the menu for a celebrity-studded after-party at the Academy Awards.</p><p>Robert’s first book, Mission: Cook! (Harper Collins, 2007), was published in September 2007, and his latest cookbook, Impossible to Easy (Harper Collins), was released in 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqfl7KzwIyiqa%2BhnprAbq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6ywJyrZpuRp7KmvoyarpqqlKh6r7HTZq6oqqSdeq21xZ5krKyfp8Zw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-richard-blosil-age-10-facts-to-know-about.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew Richard Blosil Age: 10 Facts To Know About</span></a>
