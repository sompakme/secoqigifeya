He has made a fortune, and that has enabled him to live like an absolute king. In fact, he may have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lived so largely </a>that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the house he has had up for sale since 2018 </a>is way out of most people's league. He's been trying to sell his mansion for 3 years now, and has turned to a shift in advertising and a new realtor in order to make it happen. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House Beautiful </a>reports that after sitting for so long on the market without generating a serious buyer, the mansion has now undergone some changes, in an effort to entice a sale. Most would assume that owning Shaquille O'Neal's former home would be a huge draw, but the new approach to selling his massive $16.5 million home is to remove the majority of references to his image.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwayne Johnson Buys Paul Reiser's $28 Million Beverly Park Mansion</a></span></p><p>Shaquille O'Neal lived in a stunning 31,000 square foot mansion. That's not a typo. This immense home is as large as the life that Shaquille has led, and it boasts features and amenities like no other.</p><p>Each room within this enormous property is incredibly spacious, with ultra high ceilings and open concept spaces. However, previous agents were unable to unload this property and the new realtor thinks he knows why.</p><p>Working on behalf of Sotheby’s International Realty, Benjamin Hillman is the latest real estate agent to take charge of the sale of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this massive estate</a>, located on 9927 Giffin Court in Windermere, and rather than play up the Shaq features, he is dramatically playing them down, claiming they were "too much" for many buyers. For starters, he took down a life size Superman statue that appeared at the front of the home. He also removed the "S" monogram that was predominantly featured throughout various parts of the home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The mansion has been completely redesigned, and stripped of the elements that were indicative of Shaquille's unique, personal style choices.</p><p>What remains, is a subdued version of what once was the 'loudly decorated' home of a basketball legend.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lima Ohio</a> reports that this property is; "walled off from the street and behind a gate inside the gated Isleworth Golf and Country Club, the 12-bedroom, 11-bathroom manor sits on 3.9 acres, including 700 feet of waterfront."</p><p>Some of the features within this home will absolutely stun potential buyers. For starters, there is a 6,000 square foot indoor basketball court. There is also a showroom style garage that can easily store well over 17 vehicles in showroom style, by putting them on display and allowing for ample viewing space between each luxurious automobile.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home office overlooks the waterfront with a full view of Lake Butler, and the kitchen is a massive, open concept area that can easily be used for entertaining.</p><p>Aside from the obviously<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> impressive features that this mansion includes</a>, were some other features that aren't as widely possible and may have hindered the sale of this sprawling estate.</p><p>Now looking sharp, modern and toned down from the blatant references to Shaquille O'Neal's ownership, the mansion has hit the market for $16.5 million, with high hopes for a quick sale.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Wayne Buys Massive $15 Million Hidden Hills Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House Beautiful,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lima Ohio,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dallas News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAqa3QrqOlnV2ku6aty2asp6ufobFuu9GlmKecn2K6orrSoqanZZSawKmt0KKdsqGenHqurcqepq%2BdomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shannon-miller-baby-girl-gymnast-names-daughter-sterling-diane.html><span>←</span><span>Shannon Miller Baby Girl: Gymnast Names Daughter Sterling Diane</span></a>
