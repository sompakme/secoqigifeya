She wore a black strapless Celine gown adorned with a bow at the waistline and paired the look with Christian Louboutin shoes and Bulgari jewelry. Phillippe, for her part, rocked a strapless black embellished tulle dress by Monique Lhuillier with Louboutin shoes and a Celine bag.</p><p>Before smiling for the photos, Ava gave a quick hug to Witherspoon’s pal <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong>. Witherspoon attended the awards show on Sunday in celebration of The Morning Show, in which she is nominated for Best Actress in a Drama Series. (Aniston, 54, is also nominated for the same award.)</p><p>Witherspoon took to her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Sunday to share snaps standing next to her daughter, writing, “Mother daughter date night.”</p><p>It’s been a family affair to awards shows for Witherspoon, who previously brought son <strong>Deacon Phillippe</strong>, 20, <a href=#>as her plus one</a> to the Golden Globes last week. Witherspoon wore a strapless black gown with an asymmetrical blush-colored twisted top and matching black heels, and paired the look with a diamond choker necklace, diamond earrings and a bracelet. Deacon, for his part, rocked a black tux.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reese-Witherspoon-and-Daughter-Ava-at-Critics-Choice.jpg><p>While walking the red carpet, Deacon made headlines when he sweetly swiped his hand across a strand of Witherspoon’s hair to <a href=#>fix it back</a>.</p><p>Before hitting the red carpet at the Golden Globes, Witherspoon and Deacon attended the Vanity Fair pre-Golden Globes party in Los Angeles. She donned a sparkly red gown with matching red heels and a black jacket while Deacon wore a navy blue suit with a white shirt.</p><p>The awards show last week was the first one Witherspoon had attended since her divorce from <strong>Jim Toth</strong> in March. The former couple, who share son Tennessee, 11, wed after her split from ex <strong>Ryan Phillippe</strong>. (Witherspoon shares Deacon and Ava with Ryan, 49.)</p><p>After Witherspoon settled her divorce from Toth, she was <a href=#>all smiles with Ava</a> in a sweet snap as they leaned against each other while drinking wine.</p><p>“Summer nights with my favorite daughter,” Witherspoon captioned the post in August 2023.<br>Ava, for her part, gushed about her mom in the comments section. “Looooove you!” she wrote.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The post came hours after Witherspoon and Toth’s divorce settlement was revealed. Per legal paperwork obtained by Us Weekly, the pair will have equal shared custody of their 10-year-old son and equally split his expenses.</p><p>The former couple didn’t request any child or spousal support, and submitted a request to dismiss the need for a parenting seminar because they’ve been “effectively coparenting” since the end of their relationship. The pair also kept their own cars and bank accounts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmenaOaeri106Gcq6ugpLyvecGroKefo2KxosHGoaueql2Ww6J506hka2hiaXqkvsitoJyrXZi1sLXCnmSar5GnsbR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-hulk-hogan-s-daughter-brooke-hogan.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Hulk Hogans Daughter, Brooke Hogan</span></a>
