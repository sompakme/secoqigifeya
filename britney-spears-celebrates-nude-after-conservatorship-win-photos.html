The hearing “was a very important day for Britney,” the source told Us, adding that Britney was “surprised by Sam with a vacation” amid her conservatorship battle.</p><p>The couple, who started dating in 2016, <a href=#>announced their engagement</a> last month. “I can’t f–king believe it,” <a href=#>the Mickey Mouse Club alum</a>, who shares sons <a href=#><strong>Preston</strong></a>, 16, and <a href=#><strong>Jayden</strong></a>, 15, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kevin Federline</strong></a>, captioned her September 12 Instagram reveal.</p><p>News of the proposal came three months after the Grammy winner said she hoped to take the <a href=#>next steps in her relationship</a> with Asghari, 27, during a June court hearing.</p><p>“I want to be able to get married and have a baby,” <a href=#>the How I Met Your Mother alum</a> said in her first public statement about her conservatorship since it began in 2008. “I was told right now in the conservatorship, I’m not able to <a href=#>get married or have a baby</a>, I have an <a href=#>IUD inside of myself</a> right now so I don’t get pregnant,” adding, “This so-called team won’t let me go to the doctor to take it out because they don’t want me to have children — any more children.”</p><p>However, their recent engagement wasn’t the thing the pair were celebrating while on their getaway. Us confirmed on Wednesday, September 29, that a judge suspended Jamie, 69, from his role as conservator at the request of Britney and her attorney, <a href=#><strong>Mathew Rosengart</strong></a>. The ruling came after both parties’ lawyers argued about the claims made in various <a href=#>documentaries about Britney’s team</a> allegedly tracking and monitoring her phone. <strong>John Zabel</strong> was appointed as her temporary conservator until the end of the year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jamie, who had filed to <a href=#>officially step down as conservator</a> on September 12, <a href=#>called his conservatorship suspension a “loss”</a> in a lengthy statement through his lawyer, <strong>Vivian L. Thoreen</strong>. A source told Us that Jamie ”was prepared for the ruling, but nonetheless is extremely disheartened and his biggest concern remains his daughter.”</p><p>Following the judge’s ruling, the “Lucky” singer posted a video of her <a href=#>flying in a prop plane</a>. “On cloud 9 right now 🤩☁️✈️ !!!!” she wrote.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Britney’s nude celebration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7O106ecsmWjpbKivtJmmp6klZe%2FosDErGSnrZSaeqKy056pZpufo8CmvtWaq6iqo522sXnWoqVmqJikwbC%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./antonio-banderas-lost-out-on-this-role-due-to-a-handful-of-box-office-flops.html><span>←</span><span>Antonio Banderas Lost Out On This Role Due To A Handful Of Box Office Flops</span></a>
