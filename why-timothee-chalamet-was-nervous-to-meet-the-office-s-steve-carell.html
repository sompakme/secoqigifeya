As no matter how big of a star The Call Me By Your Name and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dune actor</a> is becoming, he was still incredibly nervous to meet Steve Carell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, the two ended up working together on the notably underrated Beautiful Boy, a true story about a father dealing with his son's addiction issues. If you haven't seen this stunning, gutwrenching, and beautifully acted film... find a way to do so. It's worth your time.</p><p>Anyway, why was Timothee so nervous about meeting Steve? After all, Steve appears to be a pretty down-to-earth guy. Totally approachable... But that wasn't the case for Timothee.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Carell Admits He Used To Look Like An Adult Film Star</a></span></p><h2 id=why-was-timmy-so-nervous-around-steve>Why Was Timmy So Nervous Around Steve?</h2><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being interviewed by W Magazine,</a> Timothee described the process he went through to land the co-leading role in Beautiful Boy alongside Steve Carell. The film is based on two books, one by David Sheff and another by his son Nic, describing the real-life experience these two went through when Nic was addicted to drugs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Timothee-Chalamet-and-Steve-Carell-in-beautiful-boy.jpg><p>Timothee claims that he auditioned for the role "many, many times". But it wasn't until the last callback that he actually got to meet Steve Carell.</p><p>"The first time I met Steve was like at a chemistry read. And I'm like a big -- I shouldn't even say a 'big' Office fan. I'm like the typical Office fan, which is like a big Office fan!" Timothee told the interviewer. "And I just had to temper that because I didn't want to weird him [out]."</p><p>This is because he didn't want to lose out on this great part because he gushed over Steve's past work. Timothee told the interviewer that if he had lost out on the work because his work "sucked" or he simply wasn't right for the role, that would've been fine. However, had he weirded Steve Carell out because of his massive Office addiction, it would've been terrible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 The Office Quotes About Friendship That You Can Share With Your BFF</a></span></p><p>Now that Timothee has won the role, filmed the part, and released the movie, he can come clean about his deep love for The Office, which is one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the many awesome low-key facts about him</a>.</p><p>"He and Amy Ryan, who is also in The Office, they play Michael and Holly... they're my parents," Timothee said of his role in Beautiful Boy. Clearly, this pairing meant the world to him as it was almost as if the casting was some sort of twisted, real-life alternative ending for the Office characters.</p><p>However, in real life, Steve and Amy had been trying to get the Beautiful Boy script made for ten years. So, it makes sense that they weren't interested in messing around with any Office superfans. The script meant something to them and they were going to do just about anything to get it on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Every guy actor my age had gone in for it," Timothee said of the audition process. At the end of the day, he went into the audition room a total of six times to land the role. Yeah, Steve and Amy weren't messing around with the casting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Timothee-Chalamet-and-Steve-Carell-costars.jpg><h2 id=the-movie-also-means-something-to-timothee>The Movie Also Means Something To Timothee</h2><p>While the movie clearly meant something to Steve Carell and Amy Ryan who had been shopping it for years, Timothee also told W Magainze that the piece meant something to him to. Only after the film's release and doing press for it did Timothee realize the film's tonality and what it meant to people. It was then that he came to understand that he had just made a very important film about the anti-glorification of drugs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Timothée Chalamet’s Secret Relationship With Eiza Gonzalez</a></span></p><h2 id=timothee-got-to-tell-steve-just-how-much-he-means-to-him>Timothee Got To Tell Steve Just How Much He Means To Him</h2><p>After Timothee got the role, he was able to build a relationship with Steve Carell and tell him just how much he meant to him.</p><p>He also did this publicly during<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> an interview with Fox 5's Kevin McCarthy</a>.</p><p>Funnily enough, he did so after telling Kevin and Steve about what the actor who played the younger version of his character did when he first met The Office star.</p><p>"He was really, really excited to meet Steve," Timothee said. He then started to impersonate his castmate absolutely losing it when he met Michael Scott. "I said this to you [Steve] at the time, if you remember, that is what I wanted to say or do when I -- but I felt like I had to act cool or something..."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Timothee-Chalamet-and-Steve-Carell-beautiful-boy-interview.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In another interview with Heatworld, both Steve and Timothee publically praised each other's previous work. Steve said that he wasn't familiar with Timothee's work before Beautiful Boy. But now he's one of Timothee's biggest fans.</p><p>We're pretty sure this means the world to Timothee.</p><p>We just wonder if Steve will head to the theaters to see Dune or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Call Me By Your Name sequel</a>...
