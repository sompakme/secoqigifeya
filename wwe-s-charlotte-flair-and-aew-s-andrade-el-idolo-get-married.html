Several wrestling superstars were seen in attendance as well, including Rey Mysterio and his wife Angie, and Charlotte’s father, professional wrestling legend Ric Flair. Flair and Andrade began dating in 2019, while the pair both still worked for WWE. They got engaged a year later in January 2020.</p><p>Charlotte hasn’t wrestled since WWE WrestleMania Backlash, where she lost the SmackDown Women’s Championship to Ronda Rousey. WWE subsequently announced that she suffered a fractured radius during the match, an injury that was likely written in so that the superstar could get married and have her honeymoon. Likewise, Andrade hasn’t competed in an AEW ring since the April 20 episode of AEW Dynamite, where he lost a Coffin Match to Darby Allin. On April 30, he wrestled in a&nbsp;trios match at AAA Triplemania XXX: Monterrey.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Aaaaaaaah!!!!
