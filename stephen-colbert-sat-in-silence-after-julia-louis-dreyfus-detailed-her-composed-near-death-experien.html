It seemed like Colbert and the audience weren't ready for such a story. Fans laughed while Dreyfus told what took place, but there was certainly a small portion of the audience laughing.</p><p>Dreyfus gave the chilling details to Colbert, <strong>"I've had a number of altercations with animals. Years and years ago, Brad and I were on boat. We were in the Bahamas, and I was far away from the boat. All of a sudden, Brad says, 'Jules, I don't want you to panic, but there's a shark in the water, and you need to come back now.' I did, I just looked at that ladder of the boat, and tried not to panic.

It felt like it was a horrible black comedy.” However, soon after, the Seinfeld star was overcome with sadness. “And then it sort of morphed into crying hysterically.
