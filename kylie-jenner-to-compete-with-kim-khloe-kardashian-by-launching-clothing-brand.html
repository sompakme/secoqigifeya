They’re all so different and independent, but they give each other a ton of advice.”</p><p>If Kylie’s new fashion brand is half as successful as her makeup company, Kylie Cosmetics, it’ll be a huge success. Since launching the makeup brand in 2015, Kylie has transformed it into a billion-dollar brand.</p><p>In late 2019, Jenner made a significant business move by selling a majority stake of 51% in her cosmetics and skincare brand, Kylie Cosmetics, to Coty for a substantial $600 million. This transaction valued her company at an impressive $1.2 billion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Kim’s company SKIMS is nearly quadruple the value. Just last month, Kim's shapewear and lingerie brand reached an astonishing valuation of $4 billion. Additionally, she's currently engaged in discussions with Coty regarding the possibility of repurchasing the minority share she had previously sold in her beauty company, Skkn.</p><p>“It has grown quickly, and we’re so proud of that,” <a href=#>Kim said of reaching a $4 billion valuation.</a> “We’ve had a really good flow of product launches.”</p><p>Introduced in 2019, Kim initiated the shapewear brand, which has since broadened its offerings to encompass an array of attire, ranging from swimwear to comfortable lounge outfits. SKIMS has outlined its intentions to venture into men's apparel come autumn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The escalating value of SKIMS is evident, and this expansion goes beyond the diversification of its product range. A few month ago, SKIMS officially announced its plans to inaugurate its inaugural flagship store within the United States.</p><p>Preparations are currently underway for the launch of a physical retail outlet by the company, set to commence its operations in Los Angeles early in 2024. A retail space spanning more than 5,000 square feet has reportedly been secured for this purpose. This establishment will find its place on Sunset Boulevard, strategically positioned near establishments such as Supreme and Kilth.</p><p>Needless to say, Kylie has some big competition if she hopes to make her own fashion brand as successful as Kim’s SKIMS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: &nbsp;<a href=#>Britney Spears Buys A New Puppy After Settling Custody Of Her Dogs With Sam Asghari</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>New York Times</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4urjInmSjnZ6jsrN506hknKedpbK1sYywoK2gXaC2rnnKoaOonV2grrOwwKyfopmeYq%2B6ecuarKebmJ67qHnCpaatoJmjtG6u0ZqlnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hersey-hawkins-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Hersey Hawkins Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
