Although the question was in the form of a statement, Oprah's tone was looking for confirmation from Beyoncé. Beyoncé appeared reluctant at Oprah's matter-of-fact inquiry, but eventually replied with a simple, "yeah."However, this simple response was quickly followed by Beyoncé explaining why she doesn't want to disclose any more details about her romantic relationship, ultimately shutting down any further questioning from Oprah:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don't actually talk about who I'm dating, who i'm not... because I think it's important that I concentrate on the music, and when you start talking about those things, they become bigger than the art."</p><p>Oprah, paradoxically, responded in agreement to Beyoncé's choice not to reveal information about her and Jay-Z's relationship, saying, "It should be private, and I wish if I had to do it all over again, I would have never mentioned what's his name's name."Beyoncé's refusal to broadcast her relationship with Oprah and the world wasn't the first time, and it sure wasn't the last.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-does-beyonc-eacute-want-to-keep-her-life-private>Why Does Beyoncé Want To Keep Her Life Private?</h2><p>Beyoncé's choice to keep her relationship private with Jay-Z has roots in the way she was raised.Growing up in the southern state of Texas, Beyoncé believes her upbringing had an impact on the way she approached fame. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Oprah Winfrey this in a 2013 interview</a>: "Probably because of my mother and my foundation... it's one of the things I've always been connected to.
