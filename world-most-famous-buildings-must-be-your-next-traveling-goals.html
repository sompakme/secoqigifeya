It is not because of its familiarity in the world, but because of their heritage and how little they make you feel viewing the best achievements of human beings.&nbsp;</p><p>So, here is our take on the most famous buildings which are famous for many reasons like some of them are <a href=#>famous for their architectural</a> attraction, others for their historical values, and some of them for both.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Kabba – Mecca, Saudi Arabia</h2><p>The Kaaba which means cube in Arabic. It is a square building situated in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is the highest sacred place for Muslims in Islam that represents the metaphorical house of God and his oneness in Islam.

Its total size occupying roughly 627 square feet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Colosseum — Rome, Italy</h2><p>Rome’s renowned Colosseum is the largest amphitheater that the Romans succeeded to construct and part of one of the most magnificent architectural achievements. It was built during 70 and 80 A.D. and was used for gladiator presentations and other public representations, reenactments, classical mythology plays, or public executions.&nbsp;</p><p>In its construction concrete and stone were mainly used which started around 72AD and completed in 80AD. The layout and shape of the Colosseum have been the inspiration for many contemporary-day stadiums. Today it is one of the most famous Rome tourist attractions, bringing thousands of tourists each year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>St. Basil’s Cathedral — Moscow, Russia</h2><p>St. Basil’s Cathedral is the most visited tourist place in Moscow.

Little is famous about the building’s architect Postnik Yakovlev, but he was undoubtedly a fan of onion domes, sharp spikes and polygonal towers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hagia Sophia – Istanbul, Turkey</h2><p>Hagia Sophia is the significant building in Turkey. It used to be a church once, later a mosque, and now a museum, Hagia Sophia is a masterpiece designed by architects. A perfect example of Byzantine architecture, Hagia Sophia is located in Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>The building was constructed for the first time by the emperor Constantine the Great (306-337). However, because of many reasons, such as being burned down bad circumstances and earthquakes, the ancient cathedral has been reconstructed many times since. Despite this, Hagia Sophia is widely regarded as one of the great buildings of the world. And if that was not enough, the building also features in the opening scenes of the newest Bond film, Skyfall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Empire State Building — New York City, USA</h2><p>This building used to be the tallest building in the world and a movie or TV show never completed without it appearing on the screen. The <a href=#>Empire State Building</a>, a National Historic Landmark, is New York’s most renowned symbol, made with great pride in 1930 and 1931.&nbsp;</p><p>But unfortunately, the building was vacant for the next twenty years because of the Great Depression. A timeless masterpiece of the great American city, the Empire State Building has survived many more in its life. It faced a plane crash in 1945, shootings in 1997, and over 30 suicides, but it is no less of an iconic architectural wonder today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Casa Battlo, Barcelona, Spain</h2><p>Barcelona is a renowned destination among tourists who want to have a good blend of <a href=#>entertainment</a> and culture in a contemporary setting.&nbsp;</p><p>You will see some unique and well-known buildings on the account of a single architect named Antoni Gaudí.

Most recognized for its lean, the tower started to tilt during construction after soft ground on one side was inadequate to properly bear the weight of the structure.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to reconstruction work carried out in 2001, the tower currently leans at just under 4 degrees. It is estimated that it will fall in the next 75-100 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Building work on the tower started in 1173 and continued for over a huge 300 years. There has been much debate surrounding the actual identity of the architect behind the tower, the idea originally attributed to artist Bonnano Pisano but studies have also associated architect Diotisalvi.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sydney Opera House – Sydney, Australia</h2><p>Sydney Opera House is widely recognized as one of the most prominent architectural works of the 20th century.

A masterpiece of contemporary architecture, the opera house has become an iconic representative of both Sydney and the Australian nation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Burj Khalifa – Dubai, United Arab Emirates</h2><p>Its measurement is over 2,700 feet, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa is currently the highest building in the world.
