However, Scott’s claim to fame does not stop there; the talented baller also has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Don Juan reputation</a> that has landed him in the tabloids on multiple occasions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Scottie has found himself facing accusations of just about every relationship failure under the sun— starting with cheating and ending with allegations of domestic abuse. So not okay. Most notably, the basketball player actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married his first wife</a>, while he was still dating another woman. Awkward! Now fans are wondering: who is this mystery woman? And how is she doing now? Read on for the inside scoop:</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Lawrence Launches ‘Nothing But Net,’ A YouTube Show Every Basketball Fan Must See</a></span></p><h2 id=the-first-wives-rsquo-club>The First Wives’ Club</h2><p>Scottie met his first wife Karen McCollum Pippen in the late 1980s. The two quickly hit it off, and by 1987, Karen gave birth to a son Antron Pippen. According to a report by Essentially Sports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the marriage was basically doomed from the start.</a> Scottie was not even able to remain faithful to Karen before they got married... or even as they walked down the aisle. In fact, even as the basketball player was taking care of his wife and son, he was two-timing his new family; Scottie had a girlfriend at the time of his and Karen’s wedding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It will be unsurprising to some fans that Karen and Scottie filed for divorce just two short years after getting married. However, Karen seems to be at peace with her past. For one thing, Karen and Antron have kept Scottie’s last name, despite all of the bad vibes from the short marriage. Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Karen’s Instagram account</a> is even under the name “Karen Pippen.” How unexpected!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Karen also shows that she has forgiven Scottie’s past transgressions by posting old family photos, many of which feature the basketball star. One particularly adorable shot captures the family of three, hanging out in the NBA locker rooms years after the divorce. It seems that the couple’s romantic troubles have not prevented them from remaining amicable.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloé Kardashian Fans Claim Tristan Thompson Will Cheat As Soon As Basketball Season Starts</a></span></p><h2 id=mother-amp-son>Mother & Son</h2><p>While Karen doesn’t seem to have many unresolved issues with her ex-husband, her Instagram profile does not show any current photos of the pair. Other than the occasional shot from the 1980s or 1990s, Scottie doesn’t have much of a presence on Karen’s social media. But what about Antron?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Antron’s Instagram</a>, his mother continues to be his number one. In a particularly adorable photo, Antron shares a smiling portrait of himself with Karen on Mother’s Day. Both seem to be in good spirits, particularly Karen. The mama bear wore a full face of makeup for the special bonding time she planned with her son. So sweet!</p><p>If anyone doubted Karen’s popularity among her son’s friends, they only need take a quick glance at the comments section, where Antron’s buddies wish her their best. One of Antron’s crew even wrote an endearing message to the proud mama. “Ms. Karen! Haven’t seen her in a min, bro,” the friend wrote, “tell her I say ‘hi’!”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jasmine Jordan Gave Up Basketball But She Is Still In The Family Business</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-is-she-now>Where Is She Now?</h2><p>Other than her solid ties with Antron, Karen has a world of things to be happy about, starting with her career. In her capacity as a professional musician, Karen has been able to pull together some pretty awesome gigs with a group of big names.</p><p>For example, Karen actually worked as a part of the team to put together the modern soap opera Dynasty. According to her Instagram account, Karen hung out on set for part of season two, where she played the piano for the show.</p><p>The experience allowed her to mingle with the cast, and if the photos are anything to go by, Karen fit right in in with the actors. Dressed in a simple black dress and wearing a subtle face of accentuating makeup, Karen looks good next to Sam Underwood, Elizabeth Gillies and Sharone Lawrence. How chic!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerry Washington & Bellamy Young Recreate An Iconic Scene From The 2017 Show ‘Dynasty’</a></span></p><p>Karen’s photos also revealed that the proud musician feels just as comfortable on set as she does among the stars. One shot shows her lounging on her typical movie star style chair. Another features the pianist roaming among lights, mirrors and some incredible racks of costumes.</p><p>We have no idea what Karen will decide to do next. However, independent of wherever the pianist’s blossoming career takes her, we are excited to hear what she does next.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love & Basketball 20 Years Later: Pioneering A New Lane Of Rom Com</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnKekqbamec%2Bip6mdnmLEqrLEZpmenp%2Bnsm64wKuqmmWUnsOwvsKeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-demri-parrott-dating-demri-parrott-boyfriend-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Demri Parrott dating?
