Recently, sources revealed that <a href=#>the show's "highest-paid star"</a> was "disinvited" after calling out <a href=#>the series' creator and producer, Adam DiVello</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset': The Dark Truth About Christine Quinn's Past Relationship With A Sugar Daddy</a></span></p><h2 id=why-christine-quinn-was-39-disinvited-39-from-the-2022-mtv-awards>Why Christine Quinn Was 'Disinvited' From The 2022 MTV Awards</h2><p>In June 2022, a source told Page Six that Quinn was "disinvited" from the 2022 MTV Awards after a series of controversial statements about Selling Sunset's producers. "This decision didn't come from MTV. It came from Netflix/production," said the insider.</p><p>"My guess is that they knew in advance that Selling Sunset was going to win, hence why Adam [DiVello] was in attendance, and it made it less sticky of a situation to not have Christine present." However, a separate source said that "Netflix managed the ticket allotment, not Adam, and Christine was never part of that allotment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show won big during the 2022 MTV Movie & TV Awards: Unscripted. Selling Sunset was awarded the Best Docu-Reality Series award while Chrishell Stause won Best Reality Star. Quinn was also nominated for an award herself—<a href=#>Best Fight—alongside Stause</a>. That's why she was initially invited to the event.</p><p>The entire cast (including Christine) received a save the date from both MTV and from Netflix back in February for the event," said the insider. "Many conversations were had about inviting her with a plus-one, her arrival time, etc. Christine was then officially disinvited last week."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Three weeks before the ceremony, Quinn made a series of allegations against DiVello. "There's been complaints filed against him. Multiple complaints … and it's been sick," the reality star said on the Call Her Daddy podcast. "He actually told me to go fall down the stairs and kill myself at one point."</p><p>She also accused the producer of using "editing magic" on the show. "He basically berated me for being too honest and I said, 'This is my real life and this didn't happen and you know this,' to which then he was screaming and yelling at me," shared <a href=#>the How to be a Boss B***h author</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that incident, Quinn said that "to this day, [DiVello] cannot set foot on set with any of the women in the office because of misconduct." DiVello hasn't commented on the realtor's claims.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Maya Vander Won't Be Returning To Selling Sunset</a></span></p><h2 id=why-christine-quinn-left-the-oppenheim-group>Why Christine Quinn Left The Oppenheim Group</h2><p>On the day season 5 of Selling Sunset premiered, Quinn announced that she and her husband had started a company called RealOpen which allows people to buy and sell homes using cryptocurrency. "Why work for someone else when you can be your own CEO?" the reality star tweeted at the time. "It took over a year of hard work and tenacity to create this platform and patent-pending technology." In her Forbes profile, Quinn said that she left The O Group because it wasn't "forward-leaning" and "wasn't a believer in crypto."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources previously told Us Weekly, "It was Christine's decision to leave the Oppenheim Group." Fans thought she was fired after Emma Hernan—whom she's been feuding due to <a href=#>a shared ex</a>—told Jason Oppenheim that Quinn bribed a client to stop doing business with her. "So, an associate of Christine contacted my client and offered $5,000 on her behalf to not work with me and to work with her instead," Hernan said in the show, later adding, "And the worst part of it is that he said to me, 'I want you to be aware that she said that she was out to sabotage you.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ahead of season 5, Quinn tweeted: "30 minutes till the launch of #SellingSunset enjoy the new season and all of its 5,000 fake storylines!" Oppenheim and Mary Fitzgerald tried talking to her but she didn't show up to the meeting, convincing fans of her guilt. During <a href=#>the show's season 5 reunion special</a>, Oppenheim said, "Right now, there is not a place for her at The Oppenheim Group," but he's open to reconsidering. However, "She hasn't reached out to talk about it. I know that she has some thoughts on it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Chrishell Stause's Selling Sunset Co-Stars Have To Say About Her Sexuality</a></span></p><h2 id=what-christine-quinn-39-s-39-selling-sunset-39-co-stars-think-of-her-bribery-scandal>What Christine Quinn's 'Selling Sunset' Co-Stars Think Of Her Bribery Scandal</h2><p>In April 2022, Quinn's former close friend, <a href=#>Davina Potratz said that she "can't defend" her anymore</a> after allegations of bribing Hernan's client. "I truly care about Christine. So I'm sitting here trying to defend her actions to people and be sympathetic and empathetic to whatever she's going through," Potratz said of Quinn. "But it's like, she doesn't appreciate it. At some point, I would never hurt anyone, but I have to just then stay out of it because I don't know what's going on." She added that the issue didn't come up at the brokerage for "a long time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Quinn's new ally Chelsea Lazkani</a> also said that despite having "a great relationship" with Quinn these days, she was hoping "she would have been able to change earlier and she wouldn't have done some things she's done along the way." The show's new addition added that she "can't make people behave the way I want them to, so that's on her." The rest of the cast maintains that Quinn is lying about her innocence in the bribery, as well as <a href=#>skipping the reunion due to COVID</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>This Is The Team Bringing The Drama On Selling Sunset's New Spin-Off</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLWztdKtoKedXabCqrrNZq6aq12ZtrS1za%2BgrZ2UYrOzu8xmpK2uXZbEor7DrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-corey-harrison-pawn-stars-cast-member-is-set-to-return-for-a-new-season.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Corey Harrison?
