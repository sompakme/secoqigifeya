The honor, an “element of tradition, continuity and institution,” according to the Zarzuela Royal Palace, symbolized Leonor’s first official step on her road to becoming queen someday. At the time, Felipe described the moment as a “symbolic and very important step” and a reminder of the “demands that come with being the crown princess.”</p><p class=p1>Leonor made another notable public appearance in September 2017 when she celebrated 1,300 years of the Kingdom of Asturias.
