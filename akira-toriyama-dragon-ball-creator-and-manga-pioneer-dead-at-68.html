The lengthy statement alerted his fans that the acclaimed cartoonist had passed away on Friday (Mar. 1). Toriyama’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_death data-tag=death>death</a> was attributed to a subdural hematoma. The statement details the sudden death of the world-renowned creative. It was also noted that the man had no intention on slowing down on his work before his untimely passing.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We are deeply saddened to inform you that Manga creator Akira Toriyama passed away on Mar. 1 due to subdural hematoma. He was 68,” the statement read. “It’s our deep regret that he still had several works in the middle of creation with great enthusiasm. Also, he would have many more things to achieve. However, he has left many manga titles and works of <a href=# id=auto-tag_art data-tag=art>art</a> to this world.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Thanks to the support of so many people around the world, he has been able to continues his creative activities for over 45 years. We hope that Akira Toriyama’s unique world of creation continues to be loved by everyone for a long time to come. We inform you this sad news, with gratefulness for your kindness during his lifetime.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/en4.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The statement also reports that a private funeral for Toriyama-San was held with “his family and very few relatives.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As for his condition, according to<a rel=nofollow href=#> Cedars-Sinai</a>, a subdural hematoma is usually caused by a minor head injury.&nbsp;But the rare condition can be fatal in older people. “Subdural hematoma is a collection of blood that forms on the surface of the brain. The blood may press against the brain and damage the tissue,” the site reads.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Toriyama was an acclaimed manga artist and character designer. He first found success in Japan with his sci-fi comedy&nbsp;Dr. Slump. Dr. Slump&nbsp;was published in Weekly Shōnen Jump beginning in 1980 before ending in 1984. That same year, however, Toriyama-San began publishing&nbsp;Dragon Ball. The series followed Son Goku as he embarked on a martial arts-based adventure.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-08-at-11.32.05-AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Dragon Ball&nbsp;became Akira’s most successful, critically acclaimed, and synonymous work. The work also became one of the best-selling manga of all time. But the success didn’t stop there.&nbsp;Dragon Ball&nbsp;became a global powerhouse with its Toei Animation adaption. Shows like&nbsp;Dragon Ball&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_dragon-ball-z data-tag=dragon-ball-z>Dragon Ball Z</a>&nbsp;helped introduce Toriyama-San’s genius to the world.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The revolution also catapulted Goku into global icon status. For many Black fans, Akira’s work introduced them into the world of <a href=# id=auto-tag_anime data-tag=anime>anime</a> and manga. You’d be hard-pressed to find someone in the hood who is not positively impacted by Goku destroying an enemy with his signature “Kamehameha” move.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Akira Toriyama also had his hand in video games. He designed characters for Square Enix’s Chrono Trigger, Dragon Quest, and more. Some people even feel that Super Saiyan 2 Teen Gohan inspired the appearance of&nbsp;Final Fantasy 7’s&nbsp;hero, Cloud.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Upon his death, <a href=# id=auto-tag_big-sean data-tag=big-sean>Big Sean</a>, <a href=# id=auto-tag_thundercat data-tag=thundercat>Thundercat</a>, and other artists greatly influenced by his work reacted with tribute posts.&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_naruto data-tag=naruto>Naruto</a>&nbsp;creator Masashi Kishimoto and&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_one-piece data-tag=one-piece>One Piece</a>&nbsp;creator Eiichiro Oda, who were directly influenced by Dragon Ball, also uploaded tributes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-08-at-10.16.18-AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“With respect and gratitude for the creative world he has left behind. I pray for his soulful rest in peace,” Oda wrote&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Shōnen Jump’s website</a>. “May heaven be the joyous world he envisioned.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Toriyama-San taught me what it means to be a ‘professional’ and what ‘work’ is,” Sakaguchi typed on<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;X/Twitter</a>. “I deeply respected him from the bottom of my heart. I sincerely pray that his soul may rest in peace.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Akira Toriyama had a big 2024 planned. A video game based on his work, Sand Land, was set to arrive this year.&nbsp;Dragon Ball&nbsp;properties were already in the midst of transitioning to his son, Sasuke Toriyama. Prior to his passing, Akira had been working alongside his protegé, Toyotarou, to publish more entries to the&nbsp;Dragon Ball Super&nbsp;manga. A series called&nbsp;Dragon Ball: Daima, the last anime to feature Toriyama-San’s direct involvement, is set to premiere in the fall.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Akira Toriyama will forever be remembered for his tales of heroic triumph, social reformation, awe-inducing art, and wonderous sagas. Toriyama-San created a new world with Goku and Co. and changed the world we knew due to his genius.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Quiet as kept, this Black boy from the East Side of Buffalo is a direct product of his influence.&nbsp;Make sure you hit a “Kamehameha” in his memory.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">VIBE sends our deepest condolences to the Toriyama family and everyone around the globe affected by this loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a4qr7AZquoqpmurq6tjJ2pmp%2Bfo3qjrculZJyqlZbBsL6MnZyanF1rhW59kWxrcW1pZoZ0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-fast-foods-that-are-over-1000-calories-each.html><span>←</span><span>10 Fast Foods That Are Over 1000 Calories EACH</span></a>
