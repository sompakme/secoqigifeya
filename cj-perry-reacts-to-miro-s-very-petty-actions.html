He claimed that he had renounced her. Following that, the Ravishing Russian claimed that while the self-proclaimed God’s Favorite Champion does not want her, she is determined to be on the <a href=#>hunt for championship gold</a>.</p><p>“You might have left but my drive for gold did not. #Forsaken,” CJ Perry <a href=#>tweeted</a>.</p><h2 id=h-stop-meddling>Stop meddling!</h2><p>Since then, the hot and flexible wife of Miro has been looking for clients whom she could manage in AEW. She’s been scouting for talent and this past week on Collision, Action Andretti caught up with CJ Perry backstage. He seemed to show interest in acquiring the former WWE Superstar’s managerial services.</p><p>This did not sit well with Miro as he attacked Andretti, claiming he was protecting his wife.</p><p>CJ Perry was furious following Miro’s actions. She took to Twitter, claiming that the former AEW TNT Champion was being petty. She also asked him to stop hurting her potential clients.</p><p>“@ToBeMiro this is very petty. You renounced me !
