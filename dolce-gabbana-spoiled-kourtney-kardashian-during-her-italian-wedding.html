Kourtney was <a href=#>invited by Dolce & Gabana to stay in the brand’s private estate</a> in Portofino, Italy. While there, the reality star was able to hand-pick her and her family’s looks for the wedding from the designer brand’s '90s archive collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Olivia Culpo’s Engagement Ring Likely Cost Over Half A Million Dollars</a></span></p><p>Kourtney sported a number of memorable looks during her Italian wedding celebration. For the ceremony, Kourtney went untraditional in a black, corseted mini dress, while Travis was chic in an all-black suit. Both of their outfits were designed by Dolce & Gabbana.</p><p>But Kourtney’s Italian wedding wasn’t the only time she wore Dolce & Gabbana to celebrate her nuptials. A month before traveling to Italy, Travis and Kourtney legally tied the knot in a courthouse ceremony in Santa Barbara.</p><p>For the event, the reality star rocked a white, corset-style mini dress from Dolce & Gabbana, <a href=#>which apparently retails for $1,900.</a> Compared to the dress Kim Kardashian wore during her wedding to Kanye West, which cost over $500,000, Kourtney’s choice was surprisingly inexpensive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kourtney’s dress choice may have been cheaper than her sister’s, but her wedding celebration was still a lavish affair. It’s been estimated that Travis and Kourtney <a href=#>spent at least $3 million on the Italian festivities alone</a>.</p><p>The couple apparently splurged to transport their guests to Italy via private jet (they borrowed Kim and Kylie’s jets to do so), though it can still cost nearly $1 million to do so considering the number of guests the pair brought along.</p><p>While Travis and Kourtney stayed at Dolce & Gabbana’s luxury estate, they couple booked rooms for their guests at Splendido hotel, which offers rooms for around $6,000 per night.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple also rented out Castello Brown, a historic castle, for a weekend to host the ceremony and reception. They would’ve also incurred big bills from catering, open bar, flowers, and other typical wedding costs.</p><p>One atypical thing Kourtney and Travis had at their wedding was a private concert from Andrea Bocelli, which can cost anywhere between $500,000 to $749,000. They likely would’ve needed to cover the singer’s travel expenses, too.</p><p>Later in the festivities, the couple had DJ Cassidy perform exclusively for guests, which costs between $40,000 to $74,999.</p><p>Needless to say, Travis and Kourtney’s wedding was a lavish event, and not only because Dolce & Gabbana were sponsoring it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>King Charles Evicts Harry & Meghan From U.K. Home To Make Space For Prince Andrew</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Capital FM</a>, <a href=#>E!
