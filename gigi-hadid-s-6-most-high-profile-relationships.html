As Gigi’s celebrity status has risen, so has the public’s interest in her dating life. The model has had a variety of high-profile relationships over the years, some longer than others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Below, we take a look at the most famous people Gigi has dated and what became of her past relationships.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Jay-Z And Beyoncé Have A Prenup In Place?</a></span></p><h2 id=cody-simpson><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Cody Simpson</span></h2><p>One of Gigi’s first public romances was with Australian singer Cody Simpson. They met while filming the music video for his song “Surfboard” in 2013 and dated before breaking up nearly two years later.</p><p>In 2015, Cody revealed that the publicity surrounding their romance played a part in the break-up, saying, "<a href=#>The highly publicized thing made me uncomfortable</a>. Going out to dinner and there being all this paparazzi and stuff.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued, “As soon as we split, I had the realization that I was straying away from who I was as a whole person. I want to keep it low-key and focus on my music."</p><h2 id=lewis-hamilton><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lewis Hamilton</span></h2><p>Gigi was briefly linked to racing driver Lewis Hamilton when they were <a href=#>spotted getting cozy at the Monaco Grand Prix</a> in 2015. However, things appeared to fizzle out shortly after.</p><p>The duo sparked speculation again in 2018 that they were an item when they starred in a Tommy Hilfiger campaign together. One report said at the time, “<a href=#>According to sources</a>, the model has been getting very friendly with British racing driver, Lewis Hamilton, and the pair have been texting,” adding the messages were “flirty” in nature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it wasn’t long before Gigi reconciled with her on-and-off boyfriend Zayn Malik.</p><h2 id=joe-jonas><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Joe Jonas</span></h2><p>Joe and Gigi knew each other for years before they briefly dated in 2015. “<a href=#>Joe and Gigi's relationship recently ended</a>,” a source said at the time. “Nothing serious happened […] It wasn't a dramatic break up. It was just hard to make it work with their schedules. They will definitely remain friends.”</p><p>The supermodel started dating Zayn Malik only a few weeks after their split. The next year, Joe said he found it "<a href=#>interesting that she moved on so quickly</a>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zayn-malik><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Zayn Malik</span></h2><p>Gigi’s longest relationship was with One Direction singer Zayn Malik. The pair were first linked in 2015, shortly after he ended his years-long engagement to Perrie Edwards. Rumors circulated that Gigi started dating Zayn when he wasn’t single, which they’ve denied. The couple have been on-and-off for many years since.</p><h2 id=tyler-cameron><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tyler Cameron</span></h2><p>While broken up with Zayn, Gigi was linked to former Bachelorette contestant Tyler Cameron. They were photographed together in July 2019, only days after he was seen spending the night with his ex-girlfriend, Hannah Brown, who said she was blindsided by his romance with Gigi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hannah reflected on the situation in 2021, saying, “<a href=#>What’s crazy is, I loved Gigi Hadid</a>! I thought she was the coolest. I still do. I get it. I would even go on a date with her. I wanna be her friend! But never did I expect to be in a love triangle with her.”</p><p>Gigi and Tyler dated until October 2019, only for the model to reunite with her on-and-off boyfriend Zayn shortly after.</p><h2 id=zayn-malik-again><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Zayn Malik (Again)</span></h2><p>Shortly after reuniting, Gigi and Zayn announced her pregnancy half a year later in early 2020. They welcomed a daughter, Khai, the same year. However, Gigi and Zayn broke-up most recently in 2021 following reports of an altercation between Zayn and Gigi’s mom, Yolanda Hadid. Charges were pressed against Zayn, though the singer plead no contest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"<a href=#>They are not together</a>,” a source said at the time. "They co-parent. Yolanda is of course very protective of Gigi. She wants the best for her daughter and grandchild."</p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Leonardo DiCaprio</span></h2><p>Following his split from model Camilla Morrone in late August 2022, it was reported Leonardo DiCaprio had an interest in Gigi. Before long, sources claimed the two were getting to know each other and in the early stages of dating. Of their romance, a source said, "<a href=#>Gigi is grateful he came into her life</a> during this time and has said it's exactly what she needed. Leo is very laid back and she likes that their relationship is casual and easy. It's going well so far."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gigi’s relationship with Leonardo may be the most controversial. The Titanic actor is known for dating women in their early 20s. His most recent ex, Camilla, was 25 when they broke up. This has led some fans to speculate that Gigi and Leo’s romance was a publicity stunt.</p><p>Gigi is 27 years old, so she’s slightly older than then age of his usual girlfriends, which his team may feel could improve his reputation following the backlash after his split from Camilla. However, neither Leonardo nor Gigi have addressed the speculation and instead seem like they’re going strong.</p><h2 id=maybe-zayn-again><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Maybe Zayn Again?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If history repeats itself, Gigi will end up reuniting with Zayn. It's been that way since they were first linked in 2015, and now they have even more incentive to get back together - a daughter. Reports say the exes remain amicable and committed to co-parenting. Gigi may ve involved with Leonardo DiCaprio at the moment, but the actor has a reputation for short romances. So, we may not have seen the last of Zayn and Gigi, after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieop%2BZYrWisMidqmaln6jBbrTIoJ9mqKKks6q4xGapnqSRqbawutKhoKmrXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-ribas-boyfriend-is-the-mma-fighter-dating-julio-arantes.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Ribas Boyfriend: Is The MMA Fighter Dating Julio Arantes?</span></a>
