Although many of them fail, national team player Sebastian Lletget, 30, and award-winning music sensation and actress Becky G, 25, has made theirs work.</p><p>The singer believes that it is interesting to say there are a lot of similarities in their worlds, but they’re also quite different. Of course, they are famous, and it’s cool to hear if that’s how it looks from the outside, but on the inside, it’s just them doing what they love to do with the person they love.</p><p>The Covid and homestay orders were a blessing for the couple. Since the government issued the quarantine orders in March, it’s been a blessing for them since they’ve never had the chance to spend as much time as they have.</p><p>But the pair were also incredibly compassionate, understanding that it’s not like that for many couples. They knew that many people were struggling and going through real-life situations similar to theirs.</p><p>They started with a long-distance relationship. Even though the couple had been together four years, that was the longest non-interrupted time they have been able to spend even in their apartment.</p><p>She also revealed the secret of their relationship. One of the biggest things is their friendship.</p><p>Both are the most significant admirers of each other and are there as best friends, not only as partners.
