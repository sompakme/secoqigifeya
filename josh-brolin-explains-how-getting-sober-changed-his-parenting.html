My wife’s sober,” he noted.</p><p>After cohost <strong>Jason Bateman</strong> asked whether Josh’s family learned from his “mistakes,” the Dune actor replied, “Hopefully.”</p><p>“I think we were all pretty open,” he said. “It’s a very open dialogue with us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Josh-Brolin-Explains-Biggest-Difference-in-Parenting-His-Kids-2.jpg><p>Josh entered rehab for substance abuse in 2013. The following year, he candidly explained his decision to receive treatment.</p><p>“It was another turning point,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Guardian</a>. “It made me think of a lot of things. My mom dying when I was in my 20s. All the impact that had on me that I hadn’t moved past; I was always such a mama’s boy. But I realized that I was on a destructive path. I knew that I had to change and mature. It was like I stepped back and saw the hamster wheel.”</p><p>In November 2021, Brolin celebrated eight years of sobriety in a lengthy post shared via social media.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Sobriety is climbing in your truck for a 6am call after 8 years of sobriety and there being a card from your wife telling you how grateful she is for having made the decision to put it down and to live instead accompanied by a collage board of your children — what was created because of that decision,” Brolin wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “And sobriety is when your children look at you and trust what they see (you can see it in their pupils, and the way they stand before you).”</p><p>When asked on Monday by cohost <strong>Sean Hayes</strong> whether he can recognize “the signs” in any of his kids that they may “repeat the same behavior,” Josh replied, “No, because I think mine was so extreme that it was definitely a warning light as opposed to, ‘Let me try and emulate that to see if I can pull that off.’”</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) <a href=# rel=noopener>National Helpline</a> at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajp6OdeqO%2BzqWgp2WVrb2trcinqmagn6x6qLHTraCnn12ovKOx0WaaoZmenLKleceiqmaokaeyr8DIp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-ichiro-suzuki-a-hall-of-famer.html><span>←</span><span>Is Ichiro Suzuki a hall of famer?</span></a>
