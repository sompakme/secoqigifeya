During an interview with Extra, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twain applauded Swift for being a 'fabulous example' for young artists</a>. However, Twain also commented on Swift's schedule. Like so many others, Twain admitted such a task can be very draining.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Twain revealed, “She is living an exhausting existence, but she’s dedicated and committed to herself, to her art, and her work,” Twain said. “It isn’t even about ambition, though I’m sure that most people would call her ambitious.”</strong></p><p>Still, Twain had a huge amount of respect for Swift and the way she continues to handle herself.</p><p><strong>“I know that she’s doing the same in her own right for other young artists coming up behind her, because she is a very brave artist and a very, very hard working one."</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/your-paragraph-text-2024-05-28t084724-161.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Swifties Unite On X After A User Questions Taylor Swift's Appearance From A Candid Concert Video">Swifties Unite On X After A User Questions Taylor Swift's Appearance From A Candid Concert Video</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Calling out Taylor Swift for her attractiveness is never a good idea.</p><p>Swift herself has always shown the same respect towards Twain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor revealed in the past, “I remember when I was a little kid, I used to see Shania Twain and I just remember thinking if I ever got a chance, by some crazy streak of luck to be on a stage, I’d want to do as much as I could to say thank you,” Swift said.</p><p>Swift went on to reveal she was blown away when that very moment finally took place of meeting her idol.</p><p>“Shania Twain walked up and introduced herself to me. Shania Twain, as in the reason I wanted to do this in the first place. Shania Twain, as in the most impressive and independent and confident and successful female artist ever to hit country music.”</p><p>Swift adds, “She walked up to me and said she wanted to meet me and tell me I was doing a great job. She was so beautiful, guys. She really is that beautiful. All the while, I was completely star struck.”</p><p>A great respect between the two, but in truth, the respect for Taylor Swift seems to be endless these days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aj-mclean-was-another-artist-that-recently-had-major-praise-for-taylor-swift>AJ McLean Was Another Artist That Recently Had Major Praise For Taylor Swift</h2><p>We can add Backstreet Boys star AJ McLean to the long list of artists to praise Taylor Swift.

"It's like, 'OK, something's gotta be off about you. There's gotta be like a dark side.' And there isn't. She's just... she's met my oldest three times," he said.</p><p>"And the last time she met her, she remembered her name, which that, as a dad alone, catapulted her into the stratosphere for me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You know, we were backstage.
