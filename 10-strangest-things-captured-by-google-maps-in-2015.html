When we find weird buildings or even things that cannot be explained, it is even better. I have spent countless hours on Google Earth visiting places I have never been, and there are people who have found unusual cars, buildings and sculptures that have appeared on Google’s map feature throughout the years. Even though a lot of these things can easily be explained (no, I don’t believe in Santa Claus), it is fun imagining what they could be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Underneath the subtitles you will find the coordinates for each location, and as of November 2015, they are still visible through Google Earth or Google Maps. When you first see an object, it may not look that large, but keep in mind that these are images that are captured from a satellite in space and (similar to the rear-view mirror in your car) are much bigger than they appear.</p><h2 id=santa-s-convertible>10. Santa’s Convertible</h2><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): 35.3260364, 112.8731738</p><p>Location: Seligman, Arizona, USA</p><p>Have you ever wondered what Santa Claus does in the summer? If you think that he just heads up to the North Pole and waits for his elves to make the toys for all the children, then you are mistaken. Google Earth found good ole’ Saint Nick’s vehicle right off of Route 66 in Arizona, parked right next to a taco stand! The tacos and burritos may appear that it’s just an average person in a strange convertible, but the Christmas tree tied to the back of the car gives it away. It has to be true; there are rumors stating that he was spotted getting a sun tan right on the other side of the freeway while waiting for a burrito.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=gargantuan-bunny>9. Gargantuan Bunny</h2><p>via:panoramio.com</p><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): 44.244273, 7.769737</p><p>Location: Piedmont, Italy</p><p>On a mountaintop called Colleto Fava, lays a rather large, pink rabbit. This enormous stuffed bunny is filled with straw, 200 feet long, and is over 20 feet high. The soft, waterproof piece of art was created by grandmothers who seemingly had nothing better to do with their spare time than to knit this large rabbit in order for people to climb. This sculpture was made for people to enjoy, by Gelitin; which happens to be the Viennese Art Collective.</p><p></p><h2 id=prada-store-in-the-middle-of-nowhere>8. Prada Store In The Middle Of Nowhere</h2><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): 30.603457, -104.518484</p><p>Location: Valentine, TX</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you are driving through the desert in Texas and have a sudden urge to go shopping for a really expensive handbag, then you’re in luck if you head over to Valentine. In the middle of the city (and virtually, nowhere), there is a lone Prada store sitting on the side of the road. No, you can’t actually buy that one-of-a-kind purse here, but you can get a taste of what a real store looks like in the sand. It is said that the store was created as an art project, and vandals have repeatedly tried to break into the large building.</p><p></p><h2 id=giant-circles-under-the-water>7. Giant Circles Under The Water</h2><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): 64.833937, -13.905036</p><p>Location: Stöðvarfjörður, Iceland</p><p>It is hard to determine exactly what these circles inside an inlet, just west of the Norwegian Sea, could be. At first glance, they appear to be rather large plastic lids; but it is difficult to define the exact size of these massive tops, especially since they are being viewed from a satellite. What are they? Where did they come from? Could it be some kind of weird experiment that the natives are conducting under the water? Could it be aliens? There are a few Google-related searches, but if you aren’t fluent in Icelandic, it is challenging to translate exactly what we are seeing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=this-truck-on-top-of-a-building>6. This Truck On Top Of A Building</h2><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): 48.783530, 15.814219</p><p>Location: Weitersfeld, Austria</p><p>This seemingly large truck was spotted on top of a roof in Weitersfeld, Austria. When looking up the coordinates on Google, you can see that it may be a restaurant called Adi’s Heuriger. After researching this restaurant, it also appears that Adi’s is a bar. Perhaps someone had one too many drinks, and after leaving the establishment, somehow their vehicle ended up on top of the building. I’m not quite sure exactly how this might occur, but weirder things have happened (right?). Or maybe it is just a publicity stunt so that people from space can find a decent beverage when they leave their ship.</p><p></p><h2 id=splash-in-the-water>5. Splash In The Water</h2><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): -27.959103, 153.386209</p><p>Location: Southport, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At first glance, this doesn’t really look peculiar at all; except that it looks like a spaceship in the water. Then you zoom in closer, and it looks even more atypical. In Queensland, Australia, this large body of liquid has (what appears to be) a large splash directly in the center of it. What could have caused this splatter is unknown. Maybe something fell from an airplane above and left this splash, just in time for the Google cameras to capture it. Or maybe it could just be a fountain. Who knows?</p><p></p><h2 id=jellyfish-crop-circle>4. Jellyfish Crop Circle</h2><p>via:www.weirdgoogleearth.com</p><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): 51.562629, -1.605534</p><p>Location: Lower Denford, Swindon, United Kingdom</p><p>Most people have heard of crop circles popping up all around the world, but the United Kingdom seems to have their abundance of them. One that appeared showed up in Lower Denford, in the shape of a jellyfish, and has the community baffled as to its origins. This is the first one in the world that has this particular shape (a jellyfish). This <a href=#>600 foot long</a> phenomenon has said to have predicted future events when it was first discovered. Solar storms and a lunar eclipse had happened shortly after the encounter of this crop circle, and scientists have reason to believe that someone (or something) was trying to warn us ahead of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=fremont-troll>3. Fremont Troll</h2><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): 47.650934,-122.34728 (Under the Aurora Bridge)</p><p>Location: Seattle, Washington</p><p>Trolls have been dwelling underneath bridges for centuries; at least that is what fairy tales have led us to believe. If you visit Seattle, Washington, you will be able to visit one that lives underneath the Aurora Bridge. He also happens to be 18 feet-tall and made of concrete. The Fremont Troll was created in 1990 by art students, and has a Volkswagen Beetle in one hand, to let people know that he means business. Every year on Halloween, the city celebrates the troll by having an annual “Troll-o-ween” party, and eerie occurrences happen in the area of where the troll is located.</p><p></p><h2 id=weird-huge-triangle-in-the-middle-of-arizona>2. Weird Huge Triangle In The Middle Of Arizona</h2><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): 33.745111,-112.633645</p><p>Location: Surprise, AZ, USA</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This colossal triangle on the ground was found near Surprise, Arizona. According to different opinions, this could be an abandoned air field, a map for aliens or just a strange phenomenon. The air field theory is unlikely, since there were at least five other triangles of the same size and shape in surrounding areas, and it is improbable that there would be that many airports discarded. A map for aliens could be a possibility, but, who would be the mastermind behind this one? After careful consideration (and looking at the pictures surrounding the area), I am pretty sure that this is just an emphatically thick fence in the shape of a triangle. I apologize to all of the conspiracy theorists who were hoping for something more exciting.</p><p></p><h2 id=batman-s-helipad>1. Batman’s Helipad</h2><p>Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude): 26.357896, 127.783809</p><p>Location: Okinawa, Japan</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That’s it, the mystery is solved. We all know where Batman lives now; Google Earth has identified his Helipad in Okinawa, Japan. I was so sure that he lived in New York, but that was just too obvious. He had to find somewhere in which he thought nobody would discover him. Perhaps if he didn’t paint his logo on the roof, his secret would still be safe.</p><p>Actually, this building is the Federal Credit Union for the United States Navy in Japan, so my assumptions weren’t too far off on this one. There is no mention of the comic book hero’s insignia on the bank’s website, but it is clearly seen from space. This is probably to keep The Joker away from all of that money.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>telegraph.co.uk</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>io9.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>neatorama.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXajBs63NoJysrF2ptaq6xqxknJmgqcKzscNmmbJll6S8qLjEZqSaqKNitq95kWlobmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kirsty-hinchcliffe-dating-kirsty-hinchcliffe-boyfriend-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kirsty Hinchcliffe dating?
