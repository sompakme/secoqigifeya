As of this writing, eight talents have declared themselves for the Men’s Royal Rumble. Meanwhile, WWE has announced six women for their match. Ahead of this premium live event, various WWE Superstars were asked (<a href=#>via X</a>) what their preferred entry position would be for the Royal Rumble match.</p><p>While some competitors expressed their eagerness to join the match early, former WWE Champion CM Punk is taking a different approach.</p><p>‘There are many different schools of thought to this,” Punk said. “Obviously, strategically, you want to be number 30. I feel like a lot of professional wrestlers want to be number one to prove that they can be the Iron Man, and also win at the same time. Me, being how old I am now, give me number 30.”</p><p>Dominik Mysterio holds a similar mindset, pointing out the difficulty in trying to outlast 29 other men from the number one slot. His Judgment Day stablemate Damian Priest, however, seems to be up for the challenge as he proclaimed that he could enter first and win the entire thing.</p><p>For former WWE RAW Women’s Champion Bianca Belair, the number three spot is the most appealing, as it was the same position that laid the path for her previous victory in the 2021 Women’s Royal Rumble.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><a href=#>5 Best MVP Performances In Royal Rumble History</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNscG1vYGKwrnnPrqWkZaKaw6aty6xkoaGjYr2zscWeqaudlGKyr8DRsmSpp6Oewaq7zWagp2ViZX91ecyepaxloqTGoriMq6ymmpya</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./channel-rihanna-s-mob-wife-fashion-with-this-faux-fur-coat.html><span>←</span><span>Channel Rihanna's Mob Wife Fashion With This Faux-Fur Coat</span></a>
