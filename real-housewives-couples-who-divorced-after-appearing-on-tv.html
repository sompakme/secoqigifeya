On the most recent season of RHOBH, Erika made it clear that she had planned on staying with Tom till he passes, but that didn't come to be the case!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The duo announced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their divorce last November</a> following news that Tom and his firm had embezzled millions. While Erika claims she had no hand in any of this, fans aren't really buying her side of the story, which will continue to unravel this season.</p><h2 id=ramona-singer-amp-mario-singer><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ramona Singer & Mario Singer</span></h2><p>Ramona and Mario Singer were all anyone could talk about during the early days of RHONY. The duo had quite the picture-perfect marriage, and after nearly 20 years together, the two were praised for being able to keep the spark alive.</p><p>Well, in 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ramona filed for divorce from Mario</a>&nbsp;after discovering in the tabloids&nbsp;that he was cheating on her! Yikes. The news came as quite a shock, but not too much a shock considering the fortune teller in Morocco foreshadowed the entire thing!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teresa-giudice-amp-joe-giudice><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Teresa Giudice & Joe Giudice</span></h2><p>Teresa and Joe Giudice were the talk of the town in New Jersey, however, their 20-year-long marriage came to an end following Joe's release from ICE. After the duo served a collective 4 years behind bars, it was game over on their relationship.</p><p>Joe Giudice was deported to Italy after his sentence, making it too difficult to reconcile with Teresa from aboard. Considering all the two had been through, fans weren't the most shocked when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teresa filed for divorce.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id=cynthia-bailey-amp-peter-thomas><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Cynthia Bailey & Peter Thomas</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cynthia Bailey and her hubby, Peter Thomas were absolutely couple goals on the Real Housewives of Atlanta.

When the star returned to the series in season 8, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had only been engaged 19 times</a> before tying the knot with Marty Caffrey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two only lasted a few months before Danielle was making heinous remarks about Marty's kids, which ultimately destroyed their relationship for good. The divorce took quite some time and even had the two living under the same roof for over a year after, which certainly couldn't have been comfortable.</p><h2 id=phaedra-parks-amp-apollo-nida><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Phaedra Parks & Apollo Nida</span></h2><p>Phaedra Parks and Apollo Nida were quite the hot couple on RHOA, however, their love wasn't ht enough to keep them together.

Parks' split from Apollo <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">became official in 2016</a>, and they certainly did not end on the most amicable of terms, however, for the sake of their children, the duo have managed to make it work.</p><h2 id=adrienne-maloof-amp-paul-nassif><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Adrienne Maloof & Paul Nassif</span></h2><p>Adrienne Maloof and Paul Nassif's divorce was one that really shocked Real Housewives fans.

Today, the duo have since made things right between them, mainly for the sake of their children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yolanda-hadid-amp-david-foster><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Yolanda Hadid & David Foster</span></h2><p>Yolanda Hadid and David Foster had fostered the perfect marriage together! Their life in Malibu appeared to be as bright as their lemon trees, however, everything unraveled following Hadid's Lyme disease diagnosis.</p><p>While she has since gotten immensely better, the star claimed that her disease definitely made things hard between her and David. After her departure in season 6, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yolanda and David officially called it quits</a>, which definitely came as a shock to the cast and fans of the show.</p><h2 id=camille-meyer-amp-kelsey-grammer><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Camille Meyer & Kelsey Grammer</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Camille Meyer, formerly Grammer, was married to Hollywood actor, Kelsey Grammer. The duo share their two kids, which was documented in the very first season of RHOBH. While fans didn't get to see much of Kelsye on the show, it was all most likely because he was out cheating on Camille.</p><p>The star was blindsided by Kelsey telling her their marriage was over, which viewers were able to get a peek into come the first season. After tying the knot in 1997, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two split in 2011</a> after 14 years together.</p><h2 id=luann-de-lesseps-amp-tom-d-agostino><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>LuAnn de Lesseps & Tom D'Agostino</span></h2><p>LuAnn de Lesseps may have been over her head, especially since her friends quite literally told her she was, however, she still went through with her nuptials to Tom D'Agostino.
