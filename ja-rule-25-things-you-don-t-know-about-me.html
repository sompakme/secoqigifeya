Despite his many earworm tracks, the “Holla Holla” artist — known for his distinct, gravelly voice — still gets mistaken for other hip-hop stars from the early 2000s.</p><p>“I’m mistaken for other celebrities all the time,” Rule tells Us, revealing that “<a href=#><strong>Ludacris</strong></a>, <strong>Sisqó</strong> and<a href=#> <strong>LL Cool J</strong></a> are a few.”</p><p>The “Mesmerize” rapper doesn’t have that problem himself — he can very much tell the difference between his three favorite celebs. “I was most starstruck when I met the three Mikes,” the New York native shares, listing the stars one by one: “Michael Jackson, <a href=#><strong>Mike Tyson</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></a>.”</p><p>Rule, who shares children Brittany, 27, Jeffrey, 22, and Jordan, 17, with wife <strong>Aisha Atkins</strong>, is a family man through and through, telling Us that his “favorite single” is 1999’s “Daddy’s Little Baby” — the track he wrote for his daughter.</p><p>Still, the hip-hop icon makes it known that Ja Rule is still Ja Rule. When sharing his favorite piece of advice, the “Thug Lovin’” rapper notes, “It’s not about the money, it’s about the MONEYYYY!”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Ja Rule — including his grill master skills, his favorite piece of jewelry and more:</p><p>1.
