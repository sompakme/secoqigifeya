It's for this reason that he is considered one of the most influential figures of his generation. With an eccentric delivery and even more eccentric style of fashion, Thug has stayed in the headlines, for better or worse, since 2011 with the release of his mixtape I Came from Nothing. He then signed with Gucci Mane's label in 2013 and since then has been featured in songs with major names in the entertainment business, such as T.I., Chris Brown, Travis Scott, "Drizzy" Drake, and the controversial Kanye West.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His musical talent has earned him a net worth of $8 million, but all that money wasn't enough to keep him from being arrested in May 2022 on multiple felony charges. Before going to jail, Thug enjoyed the lavish life and decorated his garage with a <a href=#>fleet of luxury vehicles. </a>Here are the cars in Young Thug's insane car collection before &nbsp;going to prison.</p><h2 id=lamborghini-aventador-s---500-000>Lamborghini Aventador S - $500,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At 31-years-old, Young Thug, born Jeffrey Lamar Williams, has accomplished more than many people will in their entire lives. As the name suggests, he was born in an area that exposed him to a dangerous lifestyle that he not only rapped about in his lyrics, but also lived in real life at one point in time. Nevertheless, he was able to make a lucrative rap career out of expressing the perils of the Atlanta Jonesboro south projects he grew up in, where other <a href=#>rappers like Ludacris</a> and 2 Chainz also came from. One of his prized possessions that came from his success is the Lamborghini Aventador S, equipped with a 7 speed automatic gearbox, and a V12 engine that accelerates from 0 to 62 mph in 2.9 seconds, with a top speed of 218 mph, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Ultimate Specs.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id=bently-continental-gtc---250-000>Bently Continental GTC - $250,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For most celebrities who own one, the Bentley Continental GTC represents the perfect combination of speed, power, and luxury. And if there's one thing that Young Thug loves more than fast cars is luxury. Being that he is known for his eccentric style and taboo tastes, it should come as no surprise that he may be one of the only celebrities to own a pink Bentley Continental, aside from <a href=#>Paris Hilton's diamond-studded pink Bentley.</a> As if designed for the rich and famous, this vehicle provides a smooth riding experience, with a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 engine with an acceleration speed of 0 to 60 mph in under 4 seconds and a maximum speed of 198 mph. For Young Thug, it was worth every quarter of a million he spent on it.</p><h2 id=bentley-bentayga---250-000>Bentley Bentayga - $250,000</h2><p>They say if it's nice, then do it twice. Well, in the case of Young Thug, if the car brand is nice, buy it twice. He loves the Bentley brand so much that he purchased the Bentley Bentayga luxury SUV to go along with the Continental GTC. Under the engine of this beastly SUV is an optional package of a 4.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 petrol engine and the classic 6.0-liter W12 petrol engine. The great thing about the Bentayga is that it's built to dominate both on and off road environments. It's no surprise, then, that someone like the<a href=#> soccer legend David Beckham </a>would also own one of these smooth operators.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=corvette-c8-stingray---80-000>Corvette C8 Stingray - $80,000</h2><p>The name of the Corvette C8 Stingray alone is enough to strike fear into the the hearts of those who sit on the sidelines. He was lucky enough to own one of the first of its models around and has grown in popularity in recent times. This speed demon carries a 6.2-liter V8 engine that can go from 0 to 60 mph in an impressive 2.8 seconds. Thug's two-seater sports car is painted with a red exterior and a peanut brown interior. Ranging at around $80k, the Corvette C8 Stingray is <a href=#>less expensive than the other pricey vehicles</a> in his garage, but the performance it offers is worth every dollar. Other famous persons who own a Corvette Stingray include Jay Leno and Paul McCarthy!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Ways Young Thug Spends His Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=rolls-royce-wraith---450-000>Rolls Royce Wraith - $450,000</h2><p>We can safely say that when Young Thug likes something, he gets two of it, just in case one disappoints! Another typical luxury car for many celebrities is the Rolls Royce Wraith. These beasts are extremely spacious and comfortable - even the seats have a massaging feature that soothes your muscles on extended drives. Besides its colossal appearance and spaciousness, its other outstanding feature is most probably the rear-end hinged doors that just screams "Royalty!" This coupe also comes with a powerful twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V12 engine that produces 624 horsepower generated by an eight-speed automatic transmission, <a href=#>according to Car and Driver</a>. <a href=#>"Royal" celebrities such as Jay-Z and Beyonce,</a> Jennifer Lopez, Jamie Foxx, and Floyd 'Money' Mayweather also share Thug's taste in this luxury vehicle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rolls-royce-cullinan---450-000>Rolls Royce Cullinan - $450,000</h2><p>Just as he did with the Bentley, Young Thug also bought a Rolls Royce Wraith coupe as well as a Rolls Royce Cullinan SUV. After all, even city boys like to go off road at times. This big-body SUV is powered by a V-12 twin-turbo engine with up to 592 horsepower that promises a smooth ride wherever you plan to go. The plush interior seats are likened to soft leather couches built only for the wealthiest class with the deepest pockets. That's why this <a href=#>expensive class of Rolls Royce is only reserved for the richest celebrities in the world.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mercedes-maybach-s650-cabriolet---350-000>Mercedes Maybach S650 Cabriolet - $350,000</h2><p>Whenever we hear of a Mercedes Maybach, especially in the entertainment industry, thoughts of Rick Ross's Maybach Music may easily come to mind because, again, this type of car is reserved for those who can afford to blow $350k on a car. The Maybach division of the Mercedes brand is essentially an elite customization of the regular Mercedes brands. So, it makes sense that only <a href=#>millionaires like P. Diddy</a>, Rick Ross, and Kim Kardashian can afford these high-end luxury cars. The Mercedes Maybach S650 Cabriolet boasts a 6.0-liter twin-turbo V-12 engine that ranges from 0 to 60 mph in 4.0 seconds flat. It also has a top speed of 155 mph, but that can be raised to 186 mph by the AMG-engineered engine of the Maybach S650. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to CarBlogIndia</a>, only 300 copies of this model were ever made, making it an extremely rare car specimen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mercedes-maybach-s600-and-gls600---400-000>Mercedes Maybach S600 and GLS600 - $400,000</h2><p>If you haven't recognized by his selection of cars thus far, <a href=#>Young Thug</a> likes to ride around in style, and that's exactly what the Maybach S600 and the GLS600 is all about. These luxurious beauties have a majestic prowess that doesn't limit or nullify the power and poise that it has to offer. The S600 and GLS600 provide a smooth and seamless driving experience and are often seem as rivals to super-luxury brands like Bentley and Rolls Royce because of their expansive interior design and accommodating features. <a href=#>TMT Boxing Promotion owner Floyd Mayweather</a> and music entertainers Sean Kingston and Meek Mill all own a Mercedes Maybach S600 because they understand the value it offers as a luxury brand vehicle. Both the Maybach S600 and the Maybach GLS600 cost $200k a piece.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Ludacris Car Collection: Inside The Fast And Furious Star's Garage</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CarBlogIndia</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Specs</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car And Driver</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmp56dm2K2r7%2FInZxmsZ%2Bqu6h506GsoKtdnru0rc2eZJyZomKwsLjLnpqtoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-celebrities-who-were-replaced-by-imposters.html><span>←</span><span>15 Celebrities Who Were Replaced By Imposters</span></a>
