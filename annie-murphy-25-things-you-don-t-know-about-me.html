<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Annie Murphy: 25 Things You Don't Know About Me</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Funny lady! <a href=#><strong>Annie Murphy</strong></a> has been acting since 2007 but it wasn’t until she began <a href=#>playing Alexis Rose</a> on <a href=#>Schitt’s Creek</a> that she became a household name.</p><p>The <a href=#>Canada native</a> portrayed Morgan on The Plateaus in 2015. That same year, she made her debut as the spoiled and pampered daughter of Johnny (<a href=#><strong>Eugene Levy</strong></a>) and Moira Rose (<a href=#><strong>Catherine O’Hara</strong></a>) on Schitt’s Creek. What started out as a hit in Canada quickly <a href=#>became a cult classic in the U.S.</a> and pushed Murphy into superstardom.</p><p>During the show’s final season, which aired in 2020, the Lick star <a href=#>won her first Emmy</a> for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. While Murphy continued to find success on TV, starring on <a href=#>Kevin Can F**k Himself</a> from 2021 to 2022, she is still <a href=#>yearning for a Schitt’s Creek movie</a>.</p><p>“I mean, I’ve been sending [cocreator] <a href=#><strong>Dan [Levy]</strong></a> $5 a day in the mail as a bribe. So far, I have not heard back about a movie officially. But, oh, my God, I would be just over the moon if that ever came to pass because I miss everyone so much every day,” she joked exclusively to Us Weekly in May 2021. “Just to see Moira again, I would pay a lot of money to do that.”</p><p>More recently, <a href=#>the Overwatch actress</a> opened up to Us&nbsp;about herself — including who her “youthful lusts” were and what item she saved from the Schitt’s Creek set.</p><p>Read on to learn more about Murphy:</p><p>1. My favorite movies are Harvey and Anchorman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/annie-murphy-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-inline-01.jpg><p>2. The most common thing fans ask me is, “Has anyone told you [that] you kind of look like that girl from Schitt’s Creek?”</p><p>3. I have a bone under my tongue at the bottom of my mouth that confuses dentists.</p><p>4. My first car was a secondhand, mint-green Ford Focus named Beavis.</p><p>5. The most starstruck I’ve been was [meeting] <a href=#><strong>Kate Winslet</strong></a>. I asked her for her number. She’s the most famous person in my contacts.</p><p>6. My favorite item in my wardrobe is a tracksuit from Free People. I want to be buried in it.</p><p>7. I was told by a man on the internet that I look like <a href=#><strong>Margot Robbie</strong></a> if she was ordered from wish.com.</p><p>8. On Saturday nights, you’d find me on my couch, watching <a href=#>Below Deck</a> or playing GeoGuessr.</p><p>9. My favorite spot in my house is my living room. There’s a couch so big it makes me feel wittle.</p><p>10. I made pork meatballs in a green curry sauce that I was proud of. I showed my friend a picture, and she immediately zoomed in on a thick black hair soaking in the sauce.</p><p>11. I’m dying to visit my best friend in the south of France so I can stand in the ocean with my godson in one arm and baguettes and tiny goat cheeses in the other.</p><p>12. My youthful lusts were for <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Taylor Thomas</strong></a>, most of the Backstreet Boys, <a href=#><strong>Josh Hartnett</strong></a>, a bunch of hockey players and <a href=#><strong>Jude Law</strong></a>.</p><p>13. I’d love to be a 22-year-old dancer in New York who can also sing well but doesn’t brag<br>about it — or an archaeologist.</p><p>14. The song that brings back the best memories is “In Spite of Ourselves” by <strong>John Prine</strong>.</p><p>15. I suck at singing, but I kick ass doing “Goodbye Earl” by The Chicks for karaoke.</p><p>16. My favorite guilty-pleasure reality shows are Below Deck and <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a>.</p><p>17. The beauty product I couldn’t live without is the BIC EasyRinse razor. It makes shaving so much easier, and I don’t have to bang it against a sink to unclog it.</p><p>18. My ideal comfort food is mac ’n’ cheese from a box with hot dogs in it, using herb and garlic cream cheese instead of butter.</p><p>19. To decompress, I put on the TV, scroll mindlessly through the internet and then regret not having used that time to read my book.</p><p>20. To prepare for roles, I always read through the whole script at least once.</p><p>21. My folks have a cottage called Innisfree in the middle of nowhere that runs off solar panels, sits on the edge of a lake and has no cell reception. It’s a happy place of mine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/annie-murphy-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-inline-02.jpg><p>22. I have Alexis’ “Pubic Relations” diploma as a keepsake from Schitt’s Creek.</p><p>23. My favorite book is Moveable Feast.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24.My most embarrassing on-set moment falls between blanking on my lines and being busted sh—t talking on a hot mic.</p><p>25. I keep my Emmy on my bar cart under a painting my friend gave me of Alexis and David’s room.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapp6esm651KunobFdZ4JuwMeipaCrXa68tnnDqKWtZZujvLh5wJumrqxdorJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-pics-of-keanu-reeves-vs-the-paparazzi.html><span>←</span><span>20 Pics Of Keanu Reeves Vs The Paparazzi</span></a>
