The paparazzi reveled in taking pictures of the famous pair wherever they went, and fans idolized their close bond. While Swift and Kloss share a striking likeness (the two even frequently referred to themselves as twin sisters), they also share other qualities, such as equally successful careers in entertainment and a similar social circle, which helped to forge their friendship.</p><p>Swift and Kloss were once so close that they were caught up in rumors of being in a romantic relationship together. However, their friendship eventually ended in 2018. At the time, the media and fans wanted to know what happened to cause a rift between them, yet neither Swift nor Kloss addressed the reason for their fallout directly. But in recent years, certain circumstances have come out that shed light on why this famous friendship crumbled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-friendship-with-karlie-kloss-ended-after-the-model-threw-a-party-in-her-home>Taylor Swift's Friendship With Karlie Kloss Ended After The Model Threw A Party In Her Home</h2><p><strong>Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss' friendship began in 2012</strong> when Kloss tweeted at Swift in response to a Vogue interview the "Teardrops On My Guitar" singer gave, in which she mentioned wanting to bake cookies with the famous supermodel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-sundance.jpg><p>The two would later cement their friendship when<strong> Swift appeared alongside Kloss at the December 2013 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show</strong>.</p><p>Shortly after their joint appearance on the runway, Kloss said in an interview with The Hollywood Life that she and Taylor hadn't met until then but were "now BFF's."</p><p>Kloss added:</p><p>It's nice to meet another American girl.

While Swift would later reclaim much of her music by re-recording her masters, the deal with Braun, made without Swift's consent, prevented her from performing and using many of her songs.</p><p>Swift later asked other celebrities, especially those directly connected with Braun, to speak out in support of her.
