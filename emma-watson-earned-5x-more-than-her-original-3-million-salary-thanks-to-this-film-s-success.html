And, to be fair, it’s not the prettiest car on the road, but it’s good for the environment.

Disney believes that only big Hollywood stars should be paid the big money, which may be why Emma Watson's salary was based on the box office. “The IP is the star of the movie,” said a producer to The Hollywood Reporter. “If you hired Jennifer Lawrence as Belle, would it really make a difference in the opening [of Beauty and the Beast]? Unlikely.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was also reported that Beauty and the Beast star Dan Stevens, who plays the Beast, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">refused a rental car upgrade in order to accommodate his two children</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dan Stevens Revealed Emma Watson "Was Terrified Of Me" During Their Time Together In Beauty And The Beast</a></span></p><p>It was later claimed that Disney refused to pay for an upgraded flight for Cinderella actress Lily James’ mother during the promo tour for the movie. “They are cheap with everyone,” said a lawyer whose client appears in a Disney movie.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Angelina Jolie </a></strong>was one of the few live-action stars Disney was willing to pay the big bucks to have in their movie. The studio paid her $20 million upfront, plus more in profit participation for appearing as the title character in Maleficent. "If it's the right vehicle for the right star, they can be great. But Disney also has the luxury to not have to put a star in there," explained an unnamed agent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpqWRYsSiwNKopWamlal6uLvRrZ9mmpWWwrXFjJqlnWWknbJursSaqq1lYWp6rrXLpaCopl2ZvK24wKtkrJmclr%2B6ecWrpqZlY2K6qrjLoqanZZSkua2t0axm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-wwe-superstars-you-forgot-were-tag-team-partners.html><span>←</span><span>15 WWE Superstars You Forgot Were Tag Team Partners</span></a>
