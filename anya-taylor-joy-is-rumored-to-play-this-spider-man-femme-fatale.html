Previously, actress Felicity Jones played the character in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and Tricia Helfer voiced the character in The Spectacular Spider-Man animated series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Felicia Hardy has feline-based powers which include enhanced strength and agility. She also has a "bad luck aura" that she can use against her enemies. When her powers later mutate, she is granted extraordinary balance and retractable claws.</p><p>The character is known to comic book fans as Spider-Man's friend and enemy both, and the two share a complicated relationship. Black Cat was only attracted to the alter ego of Spider-Man, and is disinterested in the hero's normal life as Peter Parker. When his identity is revealed, she ends up being disgusted of him.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Signs That Andrew Garfield And Tobey Maguire Will Be In 'Spider-Man: No Way Home'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anya Taylor-Joy has been in the news ever since <a href=#>she appeared in The Witch</a>, but her award-winning performance in <a href=#>Netflix's miniseries, The Queen's Gambit</a>, solidified her role as one of Hollywood's most talented new actresses.</p><p>She has displayed her acting chops in a wide range of projects — from playing an orphan chess prodigy in the Netflix show to the psychological horror film Last Night In Soho, where she played the aspiring singer Sandie. There's nothing Taylor-Joy can't do, so we're certain fans would appreciate her taking on the role of Black Cat and giving us her own spin on it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Fans Delighted As Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Fiennes Get Cast In Culinary Dark Thriller</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp7GRYsGixcuoqWain656s8HMqKmenF2ovaqwxKtkppmeYrOmucyeZJ%2BZpJa5pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./air-jordan-12-light-aqua-to-be-available-for-women-girls.html><span>←</span><span>Air Jordan 12 'Light Aqua' To Be Available For Women &amp;amp; Girls</span></a>
