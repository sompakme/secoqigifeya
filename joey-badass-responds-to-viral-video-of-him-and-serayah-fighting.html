He addressed the ordeal on Instagram by using his talents as a spitter, captioning his latest post, “People all in our business they don’t even know the facts, they don’t see the sh*t we witness only what the cameras catch.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He paired the caption with a series of photos that showed <a href=#>the happy couple arm-in-arm.</a> Check out the post<a rel=nofollow href=#> here</a> and the original video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Many fans praised Joey for acknowledging the invasion of privacy, not letting things get out of hand, but still not revealing all the details. “Thanks for keeping us in the group chat, next time hug her sooner,” one of the top comments read under the post.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another user made a lighthearted joke about what the couple was probably fighting about, writing, “I knew it.
