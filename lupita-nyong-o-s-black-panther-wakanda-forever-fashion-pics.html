The actress has dazzled Us with a number of jaw-dropping looks while celebrating the release of <a href=#>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>.</p><p>For the film’s <a href=#>Los Angeles premiere</a> on October 26, Nyong’o, 39, who portrays Nakia in the Marvel movie, showed off her curves in a two-piece set by <a href=#>Balmain</a>. The all-white ensemble featured a one-shoulder cropped top that boasted a tiny cutout below her cleavage. The look was paired with a coordinating skirt that was equipped with cascading openings and a rope-like detail at the center.</p><p>The Us star added to her outfit by having her hair styled in a crown-like updo that was reminiscent of a work of art. She accessorized with a cowrie headband — a popular symbol in African culture that is meant to represent good luck. The action movie is largely set in Africa, in the fictional nation of Wakanda.</p><p>Eye-catching <a href=#>hairstyles</a> were a theme for Nyong’o during the film’s press tour. At a New York screening of Wakanda Forever on November 1, she drew attention to her locks as they were pulled back into a spiky top bun. The bold hairdo perfectly complemented her teal Dolce & Gabbana mini dress — the same color as Nakia’s suit in the superhero sequel. The short frock hugged the Oscar winner’s figure and was designed with a bustier construction and a flirty thigh slit. Nyong’o gave the getup a monochrome finish by pairing it with blue-green scrunch boots and a matching mini bag. Her glam was also standout as she rocked a striking metallic look.</p><p>At the London premiere, Nyong’o looked like royalty. That night, the 12 Years A Slave actress tapped Alexander McQueen, stepping out in a ruffled creation by the fashion house. The high-neck look included a contrasting gold and black pattern with a tiered skirt. She teamed the gown with dangling earrings and a halo-esque hair design, a nod to her character’s iconic ring blades.</p><p>Each red carpet masterpiece was brought to life in collaboration with Nyong’o’s longtime stylist <strong>Micaela Erlanger</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The style guru opened up about working with the Emmy holder to <a href=#>Variety</a> in 2019. “With Lupita, we always like to have a narrative and tell a story through the fashion choices … it’s not wearing a costume, it’s about promoting your work and having fun with it,” Erlanger told the publication.</p><p>Keep scrolling to bask in all of Lupita Nyong’o Black Panther: Wakanda Forever red carpet premiere looks ahead of the Marvel movie’s November 11 release:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvLrqeirJFiu7q7zaCmrGWSoa6kt4ypmKesmJq%2FbsPApJinnJFis7C%2BxK%2Bcq2WWlsCptc6nZKmhk6h8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lana-del-rey-gets-engaged-with-300-000-diamond-ring.html><span>←</span><span>Lana Del Rey Gets Engaged With $300,000 Diamond Ring</span></a>
