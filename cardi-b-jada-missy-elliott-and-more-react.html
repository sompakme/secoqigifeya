At the time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TMZ</a> reported that she overdosed on heroin, but new reports claim that is not true.</p><p>Thankfully, Demi is doing better. A spokesperson for the “Sorry Not Sorry” artist released a statement confirming that she is “awake and with her family.” “Some of the information being reported is incorrect and they respectfully ask for privacy and not speculation as her health and recovery is the most important thing right now,” the statement reads.</p><p>Demi has been very open about her struggle with addiction. She’s previously struggled with cocaine, alcohol, and Oxycontin abuse. After six years of sobriety, the singer revealed in her June 2018 single, “Sober” that she had fallen off the wagon.</p><p>See the love and light that celebrities and fans have been sending Demi’s way below.</p><p>https://twitter.com/Kehlani/status/1021857125826363392</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We love you Demi Lovato ❤️❤️</p><p>— iamcardib (@iamcardib) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 24, 2018</a></p><p><br>https://twitter.com/MissyElliott/status/1021869078976376833</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Demi … I’m over here rooting for you from the Red Table with all sorts of love, hope and prayers Beautiful?</p><p>— Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 24, 2018</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i love u <a href=# rel=nofollow>@ddlovato</a></p><p>— Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 24, 2018</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love <a href=# rel=nofollow>@DDLovato</a> so much.
