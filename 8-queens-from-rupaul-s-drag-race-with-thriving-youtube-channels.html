Just when we thought we’d seen our queens for the final time after their seasons ended, we remember that we have social media. Social media has been connecting us to our favorite queens for quite some time with varying forms of content. YouTube might be the one platform that allows for viewers to truly connect and see a new side of their favorite queens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>YouTube has been a popular site for quite some time, so it comes as no surprise that some of our favorite RPDR queens have their own successful, thriving channels. Who doesn't want to watch the charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent of some of these queens on their very own YouTube channels? Without further ado, let’s take a look at eight of the queens from RPDR that have top notch YouTube channels.</p><h2 id=bob-the-drag-queen><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bob The Drag Queen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Our Season 8 winner Bob The Drag Queen is <a href=#>one of the various queens slaying</a> the YouTube space. While many fans usually catch Bob working with best friend and drag sister Monét X Change, YouTube is a space where Bob is able to truly shine on her own. Bob’s YouTube channel is full of everything that her “Bobble Heads” could ever want to watch: RPDR reviews (also known as “Purse First Impressions”), makeup videos, vlogs, <a href=#>music videos</a>, and more. Bob truly is so talented at everything she puts her mind to, and the charisma shines through in every video posted. It’s safe to say you’ll be more than satisfied when watching her YouTube channel.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Queens From RuPaul's Drag Race Started Their Own Podcasts</a></span></p><h2 id=trixie-mattel><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Trixie Mattel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Truly, <a href=#>many fans of Trixie Mattel</a>’s could say that they first discovered her on YouTube, so of course she has her own individual channel. A lot of Trixie’s content on YouTube is centered around beauty and makeup, with the queen herself often <a href=#>testing out her latest products</a> from Trixie Cosmetics. Of course, she has a bunch of other videos up, including reaction videos, makeup transformations, toy reviews, collaborations with other queens and celebrities, and more.</p><h2 id=kimora-blac><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kimora Blac</span></h2><p>Kimora Blac’s YouTube channel is one that we’ve been watching for years. In previous years, she’s been known for reviewing airing seasons of RPDR. Lately though, her content has been centered around <a href=#>beauty and makeup</a>, and we aren’t complaining about that. Really, have you seen Kimora’s mug? We’ll be taking all the makeup advice that she’ll throw my way. You can often find her reviewing new products, dishing tricks, conducting hauls, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pearl><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Pearl</span></h2><p>Pearl is one of the Season 7 queens that is <a href=#>known for having a rocky relationship with Rupaul</a>. Nonetheless, Pearl’s career is thriving, and her YouTube is one avenue you can use to modernly connect with this queen. Her channel is relatively new, with the first video being posted around seven months ago, but the videos she has up are incredibly entertaining. You should head over to Pearl’s channel if you love watching vlogs, drag makeovers, and DIY drag tips from a Drag Race runner-up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 8 Most Memorable Lip Syncs From Rupaul's Drag Race All-Stars</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=yuhua-hamasaki><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Yuhua Hamasaki</span></h2><p>This queen from Season 10 is another one you need to be watching if you love watching reviews of the latest seasons of Drag Race.

Yuhua is such a joy to watch, and we know you’ll fall more in love with her when watching her channel.</p><h2 id=jaymes-mansfield><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jaymes Mansfield</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jaymes Mansfield is another one of our experienced Drag Race queens on the YouTube platform.
