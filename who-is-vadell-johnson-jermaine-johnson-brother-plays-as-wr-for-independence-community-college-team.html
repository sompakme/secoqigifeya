However, Oregon’s Kayvon Thibodeaux or Georgia’s Travon Walker seems to be posing a competition to him.</p><p>Some mock him as high as No.3 and as low as No.22 in the upcoming draft.</p><p>As for the parents of the two Johnson brothers, they are father Jay and mother June Roose. It seems the blood of an athlete runs in the family.
