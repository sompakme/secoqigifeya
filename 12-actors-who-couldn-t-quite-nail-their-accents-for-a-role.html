Sometimes audiences are more forgiving of a bad accent if the overall movie is still enjoyable, but not always. Sometimes, when a British actor has to play an American, or vice versa, it can lead to some very cringe moments. Although it should be noted their are plenty of actors<a href=#> who are masters of accents</a>. Still, there is also the time QuentinTarantino played an Australian, the time Leonardo DiCaprio played a South African, and the time Johnny Depp played a Native American.</p><h2 id=quentin-tarantino-in-django-unchained><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Quentin Tarantino In Django Unchained</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tarantino often writes a role for himself in his movies, and for Django Unchained he played an Australian and an employee of The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co, a cruel mining company that purchased Django. We see Tarantino's character taunt his purchased slaves with dynamite, before getting blown up in a righteous moment of instant karma. But he also taunted the audience with his awful Aussie accent. <a href=#>Collider</a> even listed it in their top ten "Worst Accents In Film."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Actually Saw Leonardo DiCaprio's Painful Hand Injury In 'Django Unchained'</a></span></p><h2 id=keanu-reeves-in-dracula><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Keanu Reeves In Dracula</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reeves is famous for his monotone delivery, and it is almost laughable to think of him trying a British accent. But that is exactly what happened when he played Jonathan Harker in 1992's Dracula. He sounds like a California surfer making fun of British people, not the insurance adjuster who falls prey to the world's most famous vampire.</p><h2 id=winona-ryder-in-dracula><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Winona Ryder In Dracula</span></h2><p>Keanu Reeves was not alone when it came to getting flack for his accent. Many critics were less than impressed with Ryder's flat delivery of an English accent, although it is somewhat more believable than Reeves. At least Ryder did not sound like she was about to say "Dude" every other line like Reeves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-winslet-in-titanic><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Kate Winslet In Titanic</span></h2><p>Although it is one of the most successful films ever made, some in the audience were not impressed with Kate Winslet's American accent. Even Winslet has said she can't stand it, "Even my American accent, I can’t listen to it. It’s awful. Hopefully, it’s so much better now."</p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-in-blood-diamond><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Leonardo DiCaprio In Blood Diamond</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DiCaprio actually went through a lot of training to nail down his Afrikanna (White South African) accent in Blood Diamond but audiences were less than interested. His attempts to be accurate are commendable, but his accent was all over the place and it just does not sit right with audiences because the delivery is so awkward and so challenging to understand.</p><h2 id=gerard-butler-in-p-s-i-love-you><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gerard Butler In P.S. I Love You</span></h2><p>Butler despises what he did in this movie. Not only does he regret the way he made Irish people sound, but how he portrayed them. Butler was so embarrassed he apologized for the film. "I would like to apologize to the nation of Ireland for completely abusing your accent,” I realize it’s a much more beautiful language and accent than what I gave. But I tried my best. I made you look like funny people.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dick-van-dyke-in-mary-poppins><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Dick Van Dyke In Mary Poppins</span></h2><p>Although a children's classic and one of Disney's most iconic films, there is one part of the film that has never sat right with viewers, Dick Van Dyke's notoriously awful British accent. Dick Van Dyke's accent is so bad it is<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> widely considered</a> to be one of the worst fake British accents In movie history.</p><h2 id=melissa-mccarthy-in-the-heat><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Melissa McCarthy In The Heat</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, McCarthy's character was supposed to have a Boston accent but the actor opted out and instead stuck to her normal speaking voice. It worked out for the better, and a gag about Boston accents was worked into the cop comedy in the "Are you a Narc?" scene with Sandra Bullock.</p><h2 id=sean-connery-in-the-hunt-for-red-october><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sean Connery In The Hunt For Red October</span></h2><p>Connery was cast as Marko Aleksandrovich Ramius, the rogue Soviet Submarine Captain. But, despite playing a Russian character, Connery makes no efforts to hide his thick Scottish accent. It was likely a mutual decision between Connery and the director, though it is a bit odd when the crew of the sub sings the Soviet national anthem in Russian while he joins in with his Scottish tones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-costner-in-robin-hood><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kevin Costner In Robin Hood</span></h2><p>Costner, allegedly, wanted to play Robin Hood with a British accent. But it was so bad that <a href=#>the director made him stop</a> and he just had Costner do his normal voice. Costner's voice in Robin Hood would go on to be a punchline in Mel Brook's parody of the film, Robin Hood: Men In Tights. When Cary Elwes's Robin Hood confronts the Prince and the Sheriff, the Prince asks "Why would anyone follow you?" To which Robin Hood replies, "Because, unlike other Robin Hoods... I can speak with an English Accent."</p><h2 id=kevin-spacey-in-house-of-cards><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kevin Spacey In House Of Cards</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before he was forced off the show <a href=#>amid controversies and accusations of sexual misconduct</a>, Spacey was riding high on the popularity of his Netflix show. Spacey played Frank Underwood with a southern accent. The only problem was that his accent is completely made up. Dialect experts cannot place which part of the south Frank is actually from, since at times he employs bits of Creole, Tennessee, and Georgia accents, much to the frustration of many southerners.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Money Has Kevin Spacey Lost Since Getting Canceled?</a></span></p><h2 id=johnny-depp-in-the-lone-ranger><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Johnny Depp In The Lone Ranger</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The casting of a white actor in a Native American role is already iffy territory, even though Depp<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> claims to have some Indigenous ancestry</a>. Either way, it makes little difference when it comes to how off his accent is while playing Squanto, the Lone Ranger's Native American sidekick. <a href=#>Native American activists</a> have pointed out how unrealistic Depp's accent was in the multi-million dollar flop.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnKyfp8Buw8eoZJynpaGxr8CMqqyirJViu6K1y2aroZ2Zp3qir8Kepa2rXZu8s3nAZqmopJVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./world-most-famous-buildings-must-be-your-next-traveling-goals.html><span>←</span><span>World Most Famous Buildings Must Be Your Next Traveling Goals</span></a>
