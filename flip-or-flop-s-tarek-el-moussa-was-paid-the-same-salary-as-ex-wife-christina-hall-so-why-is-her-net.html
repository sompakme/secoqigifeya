They were a likable couple who seemed to work really well together. And watching their relationship was as much fun as seeing what great ideas they had for the houses they worked on. It turns out that this show was very lucrative. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Christina and Tarek were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid $600,000 for Flip Or Flop's season 3</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But even though Christina and Tarek received the same Flip Or Flop salary, it turns out that Christina has a higher net worth than her ex-husband. How did Christina Hall earn so much money? And how did she accumulate so much wealth, even more than Tarek, who is just as successful as her in the real estate business?</p><h2 id=what-is-christina-hall-39-s-net-worth-compared-to-tarek-el-moussa-39-s>What Is Christina Hall's Net Worth Compared To Tarek El Moussa's?</h2><p><a href=#>Christina Hall's Christina On The Coast salary</a> is great and she earned $500,000 for season 1. Since she also has a TV series called Christina In The Country, it's easy to guess that she is being paid a high salary for both of these shows.</p><p>Many people are attracted to the type of design that Christina champions: gray and other muted colors being used in every room, clean lines, and a sunny California vibe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/christina-hall-outside.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Christina Hall's net worth is $25 million. The website puts Tarek El Moussa's net worth at $15 million. And there seem to be a few reasons for this.</p><p>One explanation could be that Christina has been earning a high income from her reality TV shows for a few years now. When Flip Or Flop went off the air, she dove right into Christina On The Coast. And it has been a successful series for a long time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why The Flipping El Moussas Bombed With Fans Despite Tarek El Moussa's Notable Fame</a></span></p><p>After Flip Or Flop ended, Tarek El Moussa starred in his own TV show as well. He and his wife Heather El Moussa renovate and decorate homes for The Flipping El Moussas. However, the show just started in early 2023, and so they have only been paid for one season so far. If the show doesn't receive a season 2 renewal, then that will stop being an income source for the couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tarek-el-moussa.jpg><p>Since Christina and Tarek made Flip Or Flop for a decade, they definitely both did well and added to their net worths. They also filmed their last episode Flip or Flop: The Final Flip. The episode aired in December 2022 and would have paid them both well.</p><h2 id=what-does-christina-hall-do-for-a-living-now>What Does Christina Hall Do For A Living Now?</h2><p>Christina Hall has several sources of income, which explains her $25 million net worth. One of them is the money that she earns from her HGTV shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/christina-hall.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina and Tarek signed deals with HGTV</a> in 2022, according to Deadline.com. These "multi-year deals" will allow them to keep making content for the network, which is great since they both seem to thrive on filming their home design and reno shows. However, while Tarek has been filming his own series Flipping 101 with Tarek El Moussa since 2021, that show doesn't get as much attention as Christina On The Coast.</p><p>While the compensation that the former couple received is unknown, it must have been high given their experience and years on HGTV.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has Christina Hall’s Relationship Scandals Affected How Fans Feel About Christina On The Coast?</a></span></p><p>Christina Hall also might have a higher net worth than Tarek El Moussa because she started a company that sells flooring. There is a link in her Instagram bio for Christina Collection Flooring. Christina also has a product called Healthy Home by Christina Cleaner that people can use to clean their floors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/christina-on-the-coast.jpg><p>The flooring has been featured in many episodes of Christina On The Coast. And anyone curious about what it actually looks like in a house can also visit the company's Instagram account and see several examples.</p><p>There are no prices listed on the website and interested prospective clients can fill out a form. However, it's easy to assume that Christina is making a good income from this business. People called it "budget-friendly," but of course, if she sells enough flooring, she will do well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with People, Christina shared her excitement over the company. She said, "I picked the entire line with hundreds of samples laid out on my kitchen island. The samples I chose were ones I would love to see in my own projects and our home. I absolutely love the way it turned out and can't wait to use it in my own projects!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Christina Hall And Ant Anstead's Custody Battle For Their Two Year Old Son Has Become Heated</a></span></p><p>Christina also noted that she has become passionate about floors over her years of flips and renovations. She said, "Flooring is my thing. It's the first thing I notice when I walk into a house and in my opinion, it makes or breaks the home. I always wanted my own line."</p><p>Christina Hall talked to People about some future sources of income. These could definitely add to her net worth. She said, "And then also an online seminar course on manifesting, creating wealth in your dream life. I think that could be pretty cool."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14487358_347348595622065_5282042263424204800_n.jpg><p>This would bring in a lot of money. An article on Vox.com shares that social media influencers can charge between hundreds to thousands of dollars per course. And people can run them for any length of time, which would raise the price.</p><p>Christina mentioned creating home decor as well. This would also be a great way for her to earn more money. She said, "I really want to start my own home line — like a Christina collection-type thing. So that's something we're working on right now, getting that in a big box store. Hopefully, that comes into fruition next year."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Christina Hall and Tarek El Moussa are both great at what they do, Christina seems to have a lot of business ideas. She continues to find massive success in her industry. And despite two divorces, she continues to keep working and seems to like being busy and having lots of things going on. It's likely that her net worth will continue to rise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidpaGgYryzecWlpqmrXamus7HKZpylZZ2kwrS%2FwGaqmqSRp8ZusddmrqKelWKwqb7IrKuippFitaK4y2alnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-irvine-s-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Irvines biography, fact, career, awards, net worth &amp;amp; life story</span></a>
