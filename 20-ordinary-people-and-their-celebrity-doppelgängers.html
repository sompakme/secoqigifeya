Don't believe it? There have been news stories of strangers without a hint of shared DNA who were innocently going about their business when - bam! - they ran into a mirror image of themselves. It happened to two gentlemen who happened to be on a plane together and two college girls who kept getting mistaken for the other. One woman was browsing Amazon reviews for a hair product and found a review where one poster attached a selfie to better show the effects of the product. Imagine the woman's surprise when she found the poster's selfie was the spitting image of her very self. Talk about destiny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're wanting this experience for yourself but are impatient or just want to give destiny a helping hand, there's a website called Twin Strangers that promises to help you "find your look-alike from anywhere in the world" and for a tiny fee, they will professionally scan your photo and match it to find your look-alike from anywhere in the world according to their face database. Celebrities are people too so it only stands to reason that the "seven people in the world" theory applies to them as well and as you'll see, with these twenty look-alikes, it sure does. Some of these everyday&nbsp;Joes and Janes with famous-looking faces decide to cash in on their celebrity-ish mugs while some of them get tired of&nbsp;the attention very quickly. How would you feel if you woke up and found out a star had been born with your face?</p><h2 id=shockingly-similar-to-sheeran>Shockingly Similar To Sheeran</h2><p>You've probably seen that picture floating around the internet of the baby who looks just like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ed Sheeran</a>. It's not even a baby picture of the singer or a baby who is related to him in any way. Apparently, Sheeran just has one of those faces. Ty Jones from Sale, Manchester is living proof of that. If you think that looking like of the most popular male singers of today would be a great thing for your love life, Sheeran's doppelgänger can attest that is not true, at least not in his case. "It's made my relationships worse I'd say because now I have to weigh up if they like me for me or are they're just interested in me because I'm the next best thing to Ed if they really like him," Jones said. "When girls ask me for pictures in the streets it's annoyed some of my girlfriends in the past and caused problems. It's hard to explain because it's not like I can help it and I don't like being horrible to people and deny them a picture if they want one."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anna-kendrick-s-corresponding-coordinate>Anna Kendrick's Corresponding Coordinate</h2><p>You probably first met&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Kendrick</a>&nbsp;as Jessica Stanley, one of Bella's friends in the Twilight franchise. Since then, Anna's career has taken off landing her a lead role on the Pitch Perfect franchise and voice-over roles on movies like ParaNorman and Trolls but her&nbsp;acting career actually began at the tender age of twelve with New York City theater productions. Anna is the perfect example of a double threat with her superb singing and acting abilities. We would almost expect her doppelgänger to possess the same kind of talents. The similarity between these two is so striking. They share the same shaped eyes, same recessed chins and same shaped mouths. If they shared similar looking noses, they would practically be mirror images of each other. Maybe the doppelgänger shares the exact same batch of English, Irish and Scottish descent in her genetic make-up that Anna has, too.</p><h2 id=couple-of-clooneys>Couple Of Clooneys</h2><p>Not a real bad deal for a man to look like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George Clooney</a>, right? The man was voted Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine in 1997 and 2006 and although that was some time ago, women of varying ages (some of them being his fellow celebrities) still carry torches for the&nbsp;actor who only just settled down in 2014 after enjoying a very long stretch of bachelorhood. Clooney's copy is missing the actor's extra dark eyes but does he also have a bit of the special G.C. brand of charm to go with the looks? Maybe only his previous girlfriends can answer that. We bet there are plenty of men out there who would call this man a fool not to use his Clooney looks to his full advantage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-s-equal>Emma's Equal</h2><p>The girl who is not&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Watson</a>&nbsp;in this photo looks so much like her that you would think that someone took a magic wand and cast a cloning spell. But the actual reason why there is a girl unrelated to Emma who looks like her duplicate is actually much more scientific than magical. Scientists say that any two random people share about 99.5 percent of their gene sequence. The .5% that is left over, says Joseph McInerney, executive vice president of the American Society of Human Genetics, there are 16 million base pairs of DNA, which is where you get “an enormous amount of individual variation." Even with that, that’s still only a half a percent of one individual's genome and only one source of unique differences. Pretty mind-blowing stuff if you ask us. But if you don't find this scientific speak interesting, go ahead and just call it magic.</p><h2 id=same-as-seth>Same As Seth</h2><p>There are plenty of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Rogen</a>-ish faces out there. Chances are good that you likely know someone who looks somewhat similar to this popular funny man. But this is a true through and through doppelgänger for Seth. The shape of their faces in general including the shapes of their noses, eyes and chins are almost identical. It looks like Seth's twin stranger may have blue eyes and that is where they differ as Seth has light brown eyes. But they even both have curly hair though the doppelgänger's hair is a few shades darker than Seth's light brown curls. If this look-alike were willing to lighten his hair, wear light brown contacts, sprout some stubble and learn some jokes, he could waltz onto the set of Seth's next movie like a boss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cara-s-carbon-copy>Cara's Carbon Copy</h2><p>We dare you to determine who is the actress that starred in&nbsp;Paper Towns, Suicide Squad and&nbsp;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&nbsp;and who is the&nbsp;Cara&nbsp;Delevingne&nbsp;look-alike from the photos above. Both girls look so similar that it's very difficult to tell them apart. Perhaps Cara's doppelgänger also has royal-ish English heritage in her bloodlines seeing as how Cara's maternal grandfather was the nephew of magazine publisher Sir Edward George Warris Hulton and the grandson of newspaper proprietor Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet and her great-grandfather was the Canadian-born British politician Hamar Greenwood, 1st Viscount Greenwood. If that's not enough, her maternal grandmother Janie Sheffield was lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret and that's only part of Cara's impressive pedigree. Maybe this doppelgänger shares some of her English lineage&nbsp;as well as her looks.</p><h2 id=two-of-hugh>Two Of Hugh</h2><p>Of the entire list, this is probably the least couple of look-alikes which would require a close inspection. But this man looks enough like actor&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugh Laurie</a>&nbsp;from House to gain attention on the street as well as quite a few double takes. We can just imagine the eternal eye roll this man is giving when people ask him if he's the TV actor or why his cane isn't with him or if he's cured any mysterious diseases lately. Judging by the man's photo, we can tell he probably just got done dealing with a throng of House fans. He definitely looks like he could pass for Laurie's brother or maybe even a future version of him on a "Where Is The Cast Of House Now" list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=j-lo-s-likeness>J.Lo's Likeness</h2><p>What woman wouldn't want to be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez</a>? The singer, dancer, actress and fashion designer is ridiculously successful and at age forty-eight, she still looks absolutely stunning, enough to rival women half her age. The next best thing to being J. Lo? Why, looking like her identical twin, of course. These days, simply looking like a successful star can make you a successful star in your own right... in the world of Instagram at least. Cruise around on any social media platform and you'll soon find a handful of J. Lo look-alikes who adjust their make-up in such a way to resemble the former Fly Girl but this random stranger looks more like a doppelgänger from the block. Her cheeks, chin and dark brown eyes and so similar to the singer and she has a bit of &nbsp;J. Lo-level confidence in her smile as well.</p><h2 id=ryan-on-repeat>Ryan On Repeat</h2><p>We wouldn't be surprised if this ordinary man turned&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Gosling</a>&nbsp;doppelgänger goes around picking up women using the opening line "Hey girl." And why not? If you looked like a top ten contender for celebrity dreamboats appreciated by women far and wide, you'd probably use your strikingly similar looks to your advantage as well. To be fair to the other doppelgängers on this list, this look-alike chose to recreate a photo where the star is wearing sunglasses so he is wearing sunglasses too. Kind of a doppelgänger cheat since we can't see his eyes and therefore we don't get the full effect. But their faces and general looks are very close beside being deprived of the whole enchilada. If you didn't know any better and saw the doppelgänger's photo on Gosling's Instagram, you wouldn't know the difference. Right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=recurrence-of-rihanna>Recurrence&nbsp;Of Rihanna</h2><p>Andele Lara was just an ordinary girl growing up&nbsp;in Boston, Massachusetts when a boy from her high school came up to her holding a picture of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a>&nbsp;from a magazine. "Do you know who you look like?" he asked her. Since then, Lara's life is a non-stop Rihanna-fest.&nbsp;"The moment I step out anywhere, everyone starts staring and whispering before I get bombarded by strangers asking to take their photo with me," Lara said. "This happens every day - It doesn't matter what I do. I can't go twenty-four hours without hearing Rihanna's name." But she appears to have taken her look-alike face in stride. Instead of getting annoyed at all of the extra attention, she just rolls with it and graciously allows people to take photos with her and even poses. She said that she's even willing to become a professional Rihanna look-alike because it's her day to day life anyway. That's the entrepreneurial spirit!</p><h2 id=a-copycat-for-christian>A Copycat For Christian</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Bale</a>&nbsp;is an English actor known for his roles in American Psycho, Batman, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises and The Machinist. His look-alike who appears to be a race car driver is probably best known for looking a heck of a lot like Christian Bale. Both men appear to be the same age, have similar noses, mouths, eyes, cheekbones, hair and all around face shapes. Along with the fact that the look-alike's ears stick out a bit and Christian's do not, the only thing missing from Christian's doppelgänger is the deep intensity that brews in the actor's eyes. We're pretty sure that these two could pass for twins but we're also feeling fairly confident that this look-alike could not pull off such a difficult role like Patrick Bateman with the skill and ease that only a talented actor like Christian could. But hey - maybe Christian can't drive a race car worth beans, either. We all have our strong suits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-ringer-for-reese>A Ringer For Reese</h2><p>Everyone says how much&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reese Witherspoon</a>'s eighteen-year-old daughter, Ava looks like her double and while that's certainly true, it would seem that an unrelated complete stranger blows even Ava out of the water in the Reese Witherspoon doppelgänger department. Right off the bat, the look-alike has dark eyes compared to Reese's light baby blues but that aside, they both have the same heart-shaped faces with strong chins and their cheekbones and noses look awfully similar. Even their foreheads seem to be the same size and same distance from their eyebrows to their hairlines. Maybe these two are distant relatives and don't know it or maybe this woman is just one of seven people in the world who happens to look just like Reese.</p><h2 id=harry-styles-spitting-image>Harry Styles' Spitting Image</h2><p>Being the doppelgänger to a twenty-three-year-old former member of a now-defunct boy band admired by girls all over the world can't really be too much of a bad thing. We are willing to bet that this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Styles</a>&nbsp;look-alike agrees wholeheartedly. Being romantically linked to Taylor Swift and now to twenty-seven-year-old Victoria's Secret model Camille Rowe probably has something to do with Harry's fame but a good chunk of that luck in the love department also has to do with his looks. So seeing as how this average Joe shares Harry's handsome mug, he likely has women beating down his door for a date. Bonus points if he can adopt an English accent!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=morgan-freeman-s-facsimile>Morgan Freeman's Facsimile</h2><p>Chances are good that this security guard spends a good portion of his day assuring people that he is not, in fact,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Freeman</a>&nbsp;pretending to be a security guard while researching a new movie role. The guard looks so much like the actor who is best known for his superb acting talents in Driving Miss Daisy,&nbsp;The Shawshank Redemption, Million Dollar Baby and 2017's Going In Style. If he grew a shortie beard, wore sunglasses and especially if he were able to talk with Morgan's distinct and beloved voice, that would cinch it. Did you know that there's actually a science behind why we adore Morgan Freeman's voice so much? It's true!&nbsp;“Some of the voices we hear all the time, they really form the backdrop of our lives,” says Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center. All the years of watching Morgan Freeman play the good character (heck, even in a movie where he was incarcerated for murder, he was a good guy!) mean that we have associate Morgan with positives. “You would turn right when he told you to,” Rutledge says of the navigation app Waze that Morgan lends his voice to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-s-twin>Taylor's Twin</h2><p>There's no better face for a young woman to have these days than that of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a>. Sharing the popular songbird's pale and striking facial features has got to give a girl a big boost in self-esteem considering how beloved Taylor is among millennials. Both girls possess full, pouty lips and their blue eyes have the same distinct narrowing "Swift squint." They even seem to have the exact same chins. The one who is not a pop star likely gets mobbed on a daily basis seeing as how she likely doesn't have a staff of private security guards like the real Taylor Swift has. There are gaggles of girls on Instagram who do their make-up a la Swift to look similar to the pop star but this Tay twin looks similar down to her bone structure. Never in her Wildest Dreams could Taylor imagine that she has an unrelated mirror image out there!</p><h2 id=benedict-cumberbatch-s-counterpart>Benedict Cumberbatch's Counterpart</h2><p>It's pretty easy to tell who the real&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>&nbsp;is here but the likeness is still pretty incredible. We also think that this look-alike could pass for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Colfer</a>&nbsp;(who played picked-on dweeb Kurt Hummel from Glee) double. But he does have Cumberbatch's long-ish face, prominent nose and something in those eyes is eerily similar as well though the actor's eyes seem to be a lighter shade. Maybe they don't look like perfect twins but they could pass for brothers at the very least. If this look-alike is the same height as Cumberbatch, he could easily get a job being a stand-in for the actor's next movie or he's athletic enough, maybe even Cumberbatch's stunt double.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-s-match>Miley's Match</h2><p>If you're not a fan of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus</a>, beware. There are tons of Miley doppelgängers lurking around. One is a twenty-one-year-old waitress who lives in California, loves Miley (naturally) and once got waved past security by Billy Ray Cyrus at one of Miley's Bangerz concerts so that he could snap a pic with his daughter's look-alike. We're not sure exactly what this Miley look-alike's story is but Miley herself agrees that she has at least one doppelgänger... sort of. Last year, she gave in to the talk that she and Justin Bieber share the same facial structure and posted a photo on Justin's Instagram that simply wished him a happy birthday along with a photo split with half his face and half her face. You may not think that the two pop singers are twin-like but if you look at the split photo, it's kind of eerie. Some beliebers even compared her to an "unPhotoshopped Justin Bieber."</p><h2 id=johnny-depp-s-duplicate>Johnny Depp's Duplicate</h2><p>Who's the real&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp</a>? It's easy to get the real actor mixed up when you see the image of his incredible doppelgänger right next to him. The Depp dup took things a step further and imitated the real Johnny's favorite tan wide-brimmed hat and his infamous arm accessories making it that much harder to tell which is which. Well, okay, sure, one does look a smidge older than the other so that might be a giveaway and if you're a diehard Depp fan then you probably recognize who's got the authentic tattoos and who doesn't. But those tiny details aside - wow! We are positively gobsmacked by how amazingly similar these two completely unrelated men look. Now just imagine this doppelgänger dressed up as Captain Jack Sparrow on Hollywood Boulevard charging a few bucks for selfies... he would clean tourists out!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=equivalent-of-angelina>Equivalent Of Angelina</h2><p>Like other celebs,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a>&nbsp;has a good number of self-proclaimed Angelina doppelgängers out there but for our money, we dub this dup the real duplicated deal. Her cheekbones look identical to the real Angelina's! Her eyes, the full lips that the actress is notorious for and amazingly enough, even the look-alike's ears look so similar to real Angelina's that there is almost no mistaking them. Though the doppelgänger's eyes seem to be a truer, richer shade of blue, her nose is just a bit more prominent and her forehead is slightly smaller, she looks more like Angelina Jolie than any other self-professed A.J. doppelgänger that we've come across... and that's saying a lot. If she has an affinity for adopting children and stealing husbands, we would warn Angelina to watch her back. It looks like she's replaceable!</p><h2 id=a-chip-off-barack-s-block>A Chip Off Barack's Block</h2><p>Looking like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barack Obama</a>&nbsp;could be a very cool thing but it could have (past tense) also have been potentially dangerous between the years of 2008 to January 2017. 2008 was a heated time for America. Barack Obama was campaigning heavily and winning hearts left and right but not everyone agreed with the calm politician's ideas and there's a reason why the Secret Service exists. After all, we have had presidents assassinated in the past. So to look like a president during a time of tension and during a massive recession may not have been such a great thing for this man during those years, especially considering that he likely does not have the Secret Service in his employ. But now that Obama is officially retired, this doppelgänger can breathe a sigh of sweet relief and perhaps go to Vegas and start a show as "The Singing Obama."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZraF2kv6W1zZqpsmWgmryxuMRmmKecXam1prXRZpqepJWXv6rA2GabqKigmrmorc2gnKurXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rhony-reunion-bethenny-calls-luann-a-complete-whore.html><span>←</span><span>'RHONY' Reunion: Bethenny Calls Luann a 'Complete Whore'</span></a>
