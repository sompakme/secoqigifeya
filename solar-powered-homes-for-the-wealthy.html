Silicon is mounted behind non reflective glass to produce photovoltaic (PV) panels that collect photons from the Sun and convert them into DC electrical power that flows into an inverter, the energy is then transformed into AC electrical power. This is a simplified explanation of how solar energy conversion works.</p><p>Photovoltaics (BIPV) have been used since the 1980's but only recently have they been used in large scale commercial and residential projects. United Solar is one such manufacturer of flexible thin film photovoltaic materials, this makes it able to integrate into the roofs and buildings of contemporary buildings. The future of solar technology lies in the integration with existing construction companies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Concentrated Photovoltaic Solar Installations are projected to boom in the next few years.

Today’s mansions and estates can be aesthetically beautiful and environmentally friendly. The expensive cost of the initial installation of solar panels will more than pay for itself&nbsp; in less than 10 years. Once solar panels are installed they produce no greenhouse emissions.&nbsp;Current solar plans have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years, the next trend is recyclable solar panels composed of aluminum, glass and silicon in a photovoltaic solar panel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all the technical jargon covered, which houses in the world provide the best solar powered domicile?
