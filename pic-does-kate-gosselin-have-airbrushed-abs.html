After all, she loves to fake bake so much, she even spent her sextuplets' fifth birthday — which was also Mother's Day — at her fave local <a href=# data-link=1>tanning</a> salon.</p><p>"When I look at Kate's pics from the previous year and then compare them to these, you can see she is taking advantage of a good tan to make her abs and arms look much more defined! Why waste that hard work at the gym without emphasizing it with a tan?" Dera Enochson, the owner/founder of <a href=# rel=noopener>Xen-Tan</a> sunless tanning products (the Olsen twins, Samantha Harris and Kara DioGuardi are fans) tells <a href=# rel=noopener>UsMagazine.com</a>.</p><p>"It doesn't look like she's had her stomach specialty airbrushed to draw in ab-muscle definition, but a spray tan will make your abs look 10 times better," adds Enochson. (Just ask <strong>Mariah Carey</strong>, who sported a little sunless contouring before performing in Macy's 2009 Fourth of July parade.)</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Mystic Tan</a> founder Ricky Croft tells <strong>Us</strong>, "While there was no airbrush used to outline her abs, a sunless tanner is definitely being used to help accentuate them further."</p><p>So how did Gosselin, 35, get that kind of definition?</p><p>"She has to be doing a lot of deep core training: planks, really working on activating her glutes," says NYC-based <a href=# rel=noopener>Crunch</a> personal trainer Jenn Burke. "When you have children, it causes an anterior pelvic tilt, which causes the stomach to look more puffy than it is. You have to align it and activate those muscles again."</p><p>Burke says Gosselin is likely maintaining her Dancing With the Stars physique by working out "an hour five or six times a week with circuit training moves full of high reps to keep the body constantly moving and shedding fat and defining the look."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Gosselin's diet is "70 to 80 percent" of keeping her toned tummy. "She'd need to eat lots of high-quality protein like chicken and fish and fruits, vegetables and high-fiber grains. Right around 1400 to 1600 calories a day."</p><p>L.A.-based trainer <a href=# rel=noopener>Whitney M. Cole</a> says Gosselin's tummy tuck, "merely removed the loose skin that stretched beyond repair during her six-baby pregnancy. The muscles are her own work… they're moving with her stride and breathing versus staying stationary on her skin, as a paint job would!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGapoZNisbCx0maimqyVYrSwv9Keo6KmXZ2ut7GMmqCrmqKqwKmxw2aYm6tdZ31yfJFybWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mick-foley-won-t-trash-wwe-new-tna-knockout-cm-punk.html><span>←</span><span>Mick Foley Wont Trash WWE, New TNA Knockout?; CM Punk</span></a>
