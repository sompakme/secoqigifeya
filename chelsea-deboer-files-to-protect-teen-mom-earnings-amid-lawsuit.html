Now, Chelsea is preparing to protect her assets, starting with the income she earned during her decade on MTV’s Teen Mom 2.</p><p>According to The Ashley, part of what Envy is saying Chelsea owes them is earnings from the reality show, which they say earned Chelsea and Cole “<a href=#>millions of dollars in revenue from Licensing Agreements</a>.”</p><p>The consulting firm claims they were directly involved in negotiating the couple’s role on the reality show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Most notably, they generated millions of millions of dollars in revenue from Viacom and New Remote Productions pursuant to certain agreements and amendments entered into therewith,” a letter Envy sent directly to the judge assigned to the case explains.</p><p>“Envy both negotiated and assisted Chelsea and Cole in complying with, all such agreements, including the Viacom Agreements. Envy’s assistance stopped when Defendants interfered with Envy’s ability to assist,” it continues.</p><p>Chelsea and Cole are denying the company’s claims, saying they had nothing to do with their relationship with Viacom, MTV’s parent company. The couple point out that they began working with Viacom long before Envy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The Viacom deal is not encompassed by the parties’ contracts and the sums sought are therefore not recoverable,” court documents submitted by Chelsea and Cole’s team says. “Envy should not be compensated for work it did not perform and was not contracted to perform.”</p><p>Chelsea announced she was leaving Teen Mom 2 in 2020 after starring on the show for nearly a decade. She originally got her reality show start on MTV’s 16 and Pregnant in 2009. She explained she wanted to offer her kids more privacy away from television now that they’re older.</p><p>However, Chelsea hasn’t said goodbye to reality TV. She and her husband are starring on HGTV’s Down Home Fab, which focuses on their love for home renovation and design.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For now, it’s unclear if Envy will be able to come after the couple’s Teen Mom 2 revenue.
