That’s 02/27/20. If you add all those numbers together — ignore the zeros — you get 13. Which in Swift speak is the number to rule them all. Her lucky number. The one she’ll often draw on her hand in eyeliner before performances. The length of the introduction to “Call It What You Want.” [Extremely Taylor Swift “Tim McGraw” voice] When you think Taylor Swift, I hope you think 13. There are a number of other hidden thirteens scattered throughout the video, but I’m getting ahead of myself. Turns out, there was also potentially a clue about the video’s release date (and time) buried in “You Need to Calm Down.” At 24 seconds in — on the track itself, not the music video — Swift sings, “it’s 7:00 a.m.” There is exactly 2:27 left of the song at that point. 2:27! 7 a.m.! Her! Mind!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The fact that <a href=#>@taylorswift13</a> finishes the “damn it’s 7 AM” line with 2:27 left in You Need To Calm Down when we’re getting The Man music video at 7 AM on 2.27...</p><p>God I love this woman <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qde9wMyMHJ</a></p>— Taylor Swift Stan (@ROCKETNUMBER13) <a href=#>February 27, 2020</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck74z3prz004d3g67akrzs2w0@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Establishing Shot</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/90d/3ba/424cf13482d90eecffe4d9788f3a52e540-taylor-swift-the-man-easter-eggs-17.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck74z5482004n3g67hgor0ax1@published data-word-count=121>“The Man” opens with, well, a man. We’ll call him The Man™️. He is staring out the window of an office overlooking a city. The window is important here. Think back to the video for “<a href=#>Lover,</a>” which opens with a little girl — later revealed to be Swift’s daughter — sitting on the living room floor staring out … a window. “<a href=#>Me!</a>” starts (after that whole snake-to-butterfly business on the rainbow pavement) with a shot of Swift through a window. “<a href=#>You Need to Calm Down</a>” has the least similar opener, but still, Swift sits inside her windowed trailer in the beginning of the video. Is this a sly commentary on gaze? A subtle reminder that we’re always watching Swift watching us??</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck752a7on00a13g67zhiw6js0@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Wolf of Wall Street</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck752ae5n00a63g67fzg5nx06@published data-word-count=66>There’s more than a little stylistic similarity between Swift’s video and The Wolf of Wall Street, a film which starred Leonardo DiCaprio as a corrupt New York stockbroker who eventually landed in prison for fraud. DiCaprio, of course, gets a nod in the lyrics in a later verse.

The paper’s third headline is fairly blurry once you enhance it, but it’s something to the effect of “MEN LOVE SPORTS.” Swift’s dating history has long been tabloid fodder and this is Swift, <a href=#>once again</a>, reclaiming that narrative. (“<a href=#>Blank Space</a>” was also inspired by this same media treatment.)</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck74zsc6900153g67ns2kxd9e@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Scotch Ad</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck74zuliv001e3g6708v463ne@published data-word-count=120>In an interview with <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, Swift opened up about <a href=#>the battle between her, Braun, and Borchetta</a>. “These are two very rich, very powerful men, using $300 million of other people’s money to purchase, like, the most feminine body of work,” she said. “And then they’re standing in a wood-panel bar doing a tacky photo shoot, raising a glass of scotch to themselves. Because they pulled one over on me and got this done so sneakily that I didn’t even see it coming. And I couldn’t say anything about it.” Does that ad for “Bo$$ Scotch” feel a little more pointed now? (Take another look and note the word “greedy” is scrawled on the subway car next to the poster.)</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Taylor: I don't write songs only for my exes, I also write songs for bitches who try to pull me down.</p><p>Here's Scott Borchetta metaphorically as Boss Scotch with "Greedy" beside his picture from <a href=#>#TheManMusicVideo</a> directed by Taylor Swift herself. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/15EfCsWGr1</a></p>— Director (@Clavis_Cularlus) <a href=#>February 27, 2020</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck74zpnla00603g6717yz5o3c@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Graffiti at 13th Street Station</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/8c9/8ab/4dddd9880a39c156566b65ffd547426651-taylor-swift-the-man-easter-eggs-04.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck74zqnjs000w3g67x1pofd3p@published data-word-count=187>The Man™️ walks over to a graffiti-covered wall in 13th Street Station. (There’s another 13 for your count.) Some on Twitter have pointed out the similarities between this shot and the scenes of Swift dancing in a subway station in the “<a href=#>Delicate</a>” video. The stations don’t appear to be the same, but hey, a nod’s a nod. The wall, where The Man™️ is peeing because he is a man and can do that, is spray painted with the names of Swift’s old album’s, Reputation, 1989, Fearless (spelled backward), Red, and Speak Now. The word “Karma” is also sprayed twice on the wall. As in, “the world moves on another day, another drama. But not for me cuz all I think about is karma.” When The Man™️ walks away from the wall, he has used his urine — which appears as, uh, blue spray paint — to spell “the man” on the wall. But as the paint drips down, “the man” starts to look like “this may.” Which could mean we’re getting something new, and possibly karmic, in May. Cool! Gross! IT BETTER BE A “CRUEL SUMMER” VIDEO!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know it says “THE MAN” but likee.. Doesn’t it alsoo sayy “THIS MAY” 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀</p><p>Could it be Taylor Swift’s next single? Or better yet?

No, this is not a reference to <a href=#>the blight of electric scooter start-up</a>s that have descended upon cities across the United States. This is, duh, a reference to one Scooter Braun, <a href=#>the music executive who acquired Swift’s former record label, Scott Borchetta’s Big Machine Label Group,</a> and Swift’s entire catalogue pre-Lover in the process. Swift called it a “worst-case scenario” in a statement alleging she’d faced “incessant, manipulative bullying” at the hand’s of Braun. She later said Braun’s purchase meant he was blocking her from performing any of her songs before Lover at <a href=#>the American Music Awards where she was presented with a special award for Artist of the Decade</a>. Braun later said this was untrue and Swift was free to sing them. The statement did not deal with the fact that the sale of her catalogue was effectively withholding it from her.

(<a href=#>There are 19 hands, which could be a nod to the 19th amendment, which gave women the vote</a>.) The stark architecture has since drawn comparison to the home of one Kanye West, the OG source of Swift drama. In the video, The Man™️ runs through the hall while high-fiving each of the hands. Almost like Swift entering the stage at a concert. Or, perhaps, a commentary on how women are subjected to the concept of the “walk of shame” after sex, while men are praised.
