These are&nbsp;10 celebrities who had near-death experiences.</p><h2 id=ozzy-osbourne><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ozzy Osbourne</span></h2><p><a href=#>Ozzy Osbourne</a> had a brush with death when he got into an ATV accident. It was just a regular day when Ozzy was just trying to have a little fun by riding his ATV around his house. "Absolutely no drugs, absolutely no alcohol. It was just a terrible, terrible accident. The last thing I remember, what I do remember is I got on the bike and, and something in my mind went 'bad move. there's something's really bad is gonna happen," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ozzy told reporters</a>.</p><p>Ozzy's heart stopped, and if it wasn't for his bodyguard, Ozzy might not be alive today. He revived Ozzy not once, but twice before he was rushed to the hospital where he had fractured vertebrae, eight rib fractures, a partially collapsed lung, and a fractured left collarbone. After a lot of rehab and time in the hospital, Ozzy is certainly lucky to be alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tracy-morgan><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Tracy Morgan</span></h2><p>Tracy Morgan is another celeb who had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">brush with death</a> when he was in a bad car accident. Tracy was in a limo with three others when a Walmart truck collided with his limo, as well&nbsp;as a chain crash with six other cars. Tracy, along with Harris Stanton, Ardie Fuqua, and James McNair were all in the limousine at the time of the crash back in 2014. Unfortunately, out of all of the passengers in the limousine, James McNair died of his injuries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Tracy was taken to the hospital he was in critical condition, as he had a number of injuries. He had to use a wheelchair and go to rehabilitation to help him recover. He also had to undergo treatments for a traumatic brain injury. Tracy is lucky to be alive, and he certainly knows it.&nbsp;After the accident, he tweeted a number of messages, expressing his gratitude for being alive, saying, "I thank GOD for my family. I am eternally grateful for the love and support they give me. My wife, daughter, sons, and friends are what got me back on my feet. I live every day trying to do right by them and make the most of this second chance."</p><h2 id=amy-purdy><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Amy Purdy</span></h2><p>When Amy Purdy was just 19 years old, she was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, a diagnosis that would change her life forever. These days she's known for being a Paralympic snowboarding champion, but there was a time where Amy was fighting for her life. Bacterial meningitis attacked her body so much so that she lost her legs as well as her spleen and kidney function. She was so sick that for a while, she thought she wasn't going to make it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking with NPR</a>, Amy explained what it was like to come so close to death. "For me, it was life-changing. I nearly died multiple times in the hospital. I lost my legs, I lost my spleen, I lost my kidney function. I lost the life that I knew. And going through so much in such a small amount of time and so quickly, for me, it put my life into perspective. There were certain things I focused on — I focused on how grateful I was for the things I had versus the things I lost. I got a second chance at life and I want to use it. I didn't want to waste it by dwelling on what happened or why it happened."</p><h2 id=gerard-butler><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gerard Butler</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gerard Butler is another celebrity who had his own brush with death. While filming the movie&nbsp;Of Mavericks And Men, Gerard had an experience that he'll most certainly never forget. While surfing, he was pulled under not once, but twice, under some huge swells, and he swore that he was going to drown.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Tana Mongeau And Influencer Friends Mourn Unexpected Death Of Ethanisupreme</a></span></p><p>"This wave spread across the skyline and it came and it was about 30 feet high," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gerard said on&nbsp;The Grahm Norton Show</a>, explaining the scary situation.

There were a few years between the aneurysms, but both of them were scary for Emilia nonetheless. "[With] the second one, I lost a lot of hope; I lost a lot of optimism. That's insane bad luck," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she explained</a>. Emilia had to go through two surgeries after each of the aneurysms&nbsp;to save her life.</p><p>She remembered during the whole thing that she was scared and just trying to stay alive. "I was wiggling fingers and toes, thinking of lines from the season, trying to do everything I could to keep myself conscious because I could feel myself slipping into a coma," &nbsp;she said. Thankfully, Emilia was strong enough to get through the ordeal and is still with us today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zac-efron><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Zac Efron</span></h2><p><a href=#>Zac Efron</a> was just enjoying an early morning bike ride alongside <a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a> when he had his near-death experience. The two were riding in the early morning, and there was quite a lot of traffic at that time. Zac didn't have much experience riding in an environment like that and therefore had a run-in with a bus that nearly took his life.</p><p>"I followed Hugh around a few cars and suddenly there was a double-decker bus right in front of me. I slammed on the brakes, and went under the front tire and narrowly missed death," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac explained the scary situation</a> on&nbsp;The Graham Norton Show. Thankfully Zac was able to live to tell the scary tale of what happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=isla-fisher><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Isla Fisher</span></h2><p>Isla Fisher had her own brush with death when she was filming the movie&nbsp;Now You See Me. In the movie, there was a scene in which Isla's character has to free herself from shackles while she's submerged underwater in a tank.

He and his friends were always catching waves, going out to surf both before and after school nearly every day. Unfortunately, when it came to something that Liam loved, he had a brush with death as he nearly drowned while surfing.</p><p>"When I was a kid, one time I got my leg rope wrapped around my whole body like a ball, underwater. Couldn't get up," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he explained</a>. "I was in waist-deep water, but I almost drowned." Thankfully, Liam was able to make it through it, and he's still here today, surfing and everything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=orlando-bloom><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Orlando Bloom</span></h2><p><a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a> had quite the brush with death when he was trying to climb a rooftop terrace.

"I'm grateful for it," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told&nbsp;Men's Health magazine.</a> "I'm always working on my back. It hasn't prevented me from doing anything. But it's a constant reminder."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-barker><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Travis Barker</span></h2><p>Travis Barker, the drummer of the band Blink 182, had a scary near-death experience.

I've replayed it a million times in my head wishing it ended differently," the drummer wrote on his Instagram. "I struggled for a long time with survivors guilt and PTSD from our accident and also because I didn't see the signs in time to help Adam afterward, I wish I could've done more. I know I am so blessed to be here and I will never take it for granted. I will make the most of my second chance here and go hard every day in their memory. I will continue to be strong and live every day as if it's my last in honor of my brothers."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mariah Carey Sends Condolences To Fan And YouTube Vlogger Lloyd Cadena After Tragic Death</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmamlZa%2FbrDEmquhZZWtvaa%2ByJ6lnJ2jZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./william-gholston-net-worth-how-rich-is-william-gholston.html><span>←</span><span>William Gholston Net Worth: How rich is William Gholston?</span></a>
