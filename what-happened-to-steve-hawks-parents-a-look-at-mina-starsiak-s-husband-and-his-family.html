For what I needed her for and what my family needed her for, [she was] much too young and much too soon”, Mina wrote. In a time when she herself didn’t see much light, she was a shining example for us. She was devastated by the loss of Rick and Sally, her parents. Stef in particular, but it affected all of them.</p><p>“Stef was taken by 2020. And our capacity to unite as a family to express our love for her in the way that she so well deserved,” she continued. “It robbed my husband of the happiness he had only recently recovered after losing his parents.”</p><p>Every celebration had a gloomy undertone as if it couldn’t forget the individuals who weren’t there. It demanded so much of so many individuals. Also, Steve hasn’t yet talked about how difficult it was to lose both of his parents in 2018 and his sister two years later. Jack, a boy, was born to him and Mina on August 8, 2018, and Charlie, a girl, was born to them on September 16, 2020.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steve-hawks-wife-and-children></span>Steve Hawk’s Wife And Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fans of HGTV’s Good Bones are probably well-acquainted with Mina Starsiak and her mother, Karen Laine, as well as their combined initiatives to purchase, restore, and flip intriguing properties that they come across on the market.
