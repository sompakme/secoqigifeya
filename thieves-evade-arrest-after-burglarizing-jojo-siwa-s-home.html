In fact, a Hidden Hills community was recently <a href=#>forced to increase its security</a> after a number of uninvited visitors showing up at Kardashian-Jenner residences. After experiencing multiple attempts in a week, the community hired extra security guards as well as new cameras as a precaution.</p><p>In January, a man showed up at one of Kim Kardashian’s homes attempting to gain access to her and gift her a diamond ring.

"I think he stops because he sees my camera lit up," she explained "The other one came an hour before him."</p><p>Once she noticed the attempted break-in, Valerie called the authorities and made a report. The cookbook author added that she was installing extra security measures. "I'm installing more motion detector lights and thinking of putting barbed wire on my front fence," she continued.
