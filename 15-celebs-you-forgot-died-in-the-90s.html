CGI in the film industry had started to gain traction, some of the best music was released, and there were plenty of interesting and weird toys that children could buy. Some of the greatest movies, like Pulp Fiction, Titanic, and The Matrix also came out during this period. At the time, the world had advanced tremendously in technology. Cellular phones, color television, and live television were becoming norms, and the World Wide Web was starting strong. Plus, the infant mortality rate had dropped almost 90%!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, however, not everything was perfect. The 90s came after a time when drugs were everywhere, and the world was still thawing after The Cold War. It was also the time the Gulf War began. And death, the one thing that all humans will have in common, definitely wasn't taking a break during this decade. Due to drugs, wars, gang violence, and natural causes, death kept taking and taking like it always has. And, of course, celebrities were no exception. A lot of influential people died during this decade -- some of natural causes, some by drug overdoses, and a few even by homicide.</p><p>These are some of the 15 celebrities who died in the 1990s.</p><h2 id=princess-diana-august-31st-1997><strong>Princess Diana (August 31st, 1997)</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Diana</a> was the first wife of <a href=#>Charles</a>, the Prince of Wales, and a prominent figure in the British Royal Family. Born into royalty, Diana married Charles on July 29th, 1981. Her wedding was remembered for her 25-foot long gown. She bore two sons, <a href=#>William</a> and <a href=#>Harry</a>, and was married to Charles until their divorce in 1996. Diana was very active in charities involving AIDS and cancer, just to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On August 31st, 1997, the world was shocked to hear that Diana had died in a car accident. The driver, Henri Paul, and Diana's partner, Dodi Fayed, also died in the crash. There were many theories as to how the crash occurred, ranging from Paul being inebriated behind the wheel to an actual assassination. To this day, Diana's image still influences the royal family.</p><h2 id=tupac-shakur-september-13th-1996><strong>Tupac Shakur (September 13th, 1996)</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Tupac Shakur</a> is considered one of the most influential and greatest rappers of his generation -- and of all time.

Shakur started his career in the arts at the age of twelve, later on enrolling in the Baltimore School of the Arts. Shakur was engaged to Kidada Jones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On September 7th of 1996, Shakur was caught in a drive-by shooting by an individual in a white Cadillac. Shakur was hit four times and was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada where he died of his wounds on September 13th. To this day, Tupac is considered by many rappers to be a martyr and a father figure.</p><h2 id=the-notorious-b-i-g-march-9th-1997><strong>The Notorious B.I.G. (March 9th, 1997)</strong></h2><p>Christopher George Latore Wallace, known by the name "The Notorious B.I.G." was a prominent member of the hip-hop community. He was born on May 21st, 1972 in New York City and was involved in drugs since the age of 12. He was married to <a href=#>Faith Evans</a> and had two children. During B.I.G.'s career, he was heavily involved in the West Coast-East Coast hip hop feud.</p><p>In 1997, B.I.G. was in California to promote his new album and record a music video. A month later, around March 9th, a man in a black Chevy Impala pulled up to B.I.G.'s vehicle and shot him four times in the chest. B.I.G. was rushed to the hospital, where he later died of his wounds. His death impacted the hip hop community as he was considered to be one of the best rappers and also since his death occurred a year after the legendary <a href=#>Tupac Shakur</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bob-ross-july-4th-1995><strong>Bob Ross (July 4th, 1995)</strong></h2><p>Bob Ross was, and still is, considered one of the happiest painters ever.

Ross was married to Jane Ross, who died in 1993, and together, they had three children.</p><p>In the early 90s, Ross was diagnosed with lymphoma. His condition soon caused him to retire with the final episode of The Joy of Painting airing on May 17th, 1994. He died a year later on July 4th. Bob Ross will always be remembered for his positive attitude and kind smile.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=freddie-mercury-november-24th-1991><strong>Freddie Mercury (November 24th, 1991)</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Freddie Mercury</a> was the lead singer of the band Queen. Some of the songs that Mercury is remembered for are Bohemian Rhapsody, We are the Champions, We Will Rock You, and Don't Stop Me Now, to name a few. Mercury was born in Zanzibar, East Africa to parents Bomi and Jul Bulsara. He began taking piano lessons at age seven and started singing in bands after his graduation years later.

He never stated his illness throughout his career, though his appearance was more ragged and frail through the remainder of his years. A few days before his death, Mercury finally came out as having been diagnosed with AIDS. On November 24th, 1991, Freddie Mercury passed away due to bronchial pneumonia related to AIDS.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jim-henson-may-16th-1990><strong>Jim Henson (May 16th, 1990)</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jim Henson</a> is remembered fondly for his creations Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, and the Sesame Street ensemble. Born on September 24th, 1936, Henson spent his youth in Mississippi until he moved to Maryland in 1940. When his family acquired a television, Henson was inspired by the early puppets and ventriloquists. In 1960, Henson was tasked to make a show for the WRC-TV, which would be the forerunner for The Muppets. Henson was married to Jane Nebel and had five children.</p><p>On May 16th, 1990, Henson had passed away due to toxic shock syndrome. Some, his mother included, believed that his Christian Science-based faith might have contributed to the puppeteer's death. A few days before his death, Henson was coughing up blood and had trouble breathing. When asked to go to the hospital, he refused.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kurt-cobain-april-5th-1994><strong>Kurt Cobain (April 5th, 1994)</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kurt Cobain</a> was the lead singer of Nirvana, their song Smells Like Teen Spirit being their most recognizable. Cobain was born on February 20th, 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington. His life started out shakily, first due to his parents' divorce and then his mother kicking him out when he dropped out of high school. Cobain was always interested in music, being influenced by The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Cobain was married to <a href=#>Courtney Love</a> and had one child.</p><p>Cobain attempted suicide several times throughout the later years of his life -- first with a combination of champagne and Rohypnol. Later, he locked himself in a room with a gun, though he claimed it was to hide from his wife. On April 8th, an electrician found Cobain's body with a gun under his chin and a suicide note on his person. His body had been there for three days, placing his suicide date at April 5th, 1994.

Co-star Michael Massee was to shoot Lee with a blank in the scene. However, there was a bullet lodged in the barrel. When the blank was triggered, the bullet was launched with a force similar to a live round and hit Lee in the stomach.
