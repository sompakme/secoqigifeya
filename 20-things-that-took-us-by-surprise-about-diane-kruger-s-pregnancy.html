And that’s not just because she’s been so quiet about her personal life lately. Instead, it’s because she’s having a baby with none other than Norman Reedus. While the two have been dating under the radar for quite some time, her announcement was definitely unexpected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But then again, Diane Kruger has made it no secret that she is head-over-heels in love with The Walking Dead star. Sure, they might look like they come from different worlds, but Diane has been telling her close friends and family that she thinks Norman is her soulmate. And now that they are about to raise a child together, these two will be connected for life, no matter what happens in the future.</p><p>With all of that being said, though, Norman has been particularly quiet about this relationship. But then again, he’s not the kind of celebrity who will blab about his romances on the red carpet. But now that he and Diane are about to become parents together, many fans have a feeling that there are big changes that are about to occur in his life. Here’s what we know so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=diane-has-plans-to-start-a-family-and-she-s-moving-fast><strong>Diane&nbsp;Has Plans To&nbsp;Start A Family And She's Moving Fast</strong></h2><p>For a lot of Diane Kruger’s fans, they were left shocked when they first found out that their favorite actress was expected her first child with none other than Norman Reedus. After all, the actress was with her ex, Joshua Jackson for ten entire years and nothing ever came out of that relationship.</p><p>Some people think that Diane might be&nbsp;moving too fast in her new romance with Norman. But then again, things do happen for a reason. Diane’s new family plans might be her destiny, good timing, a mixture of love and affection, or a combination of all three.</p><h2 id=norman-s-hesitation-about-everything><strong>Norman’s Hesitation About Everything</strong></h2><p>But then again, Norman Reedus doesn’t seem like the kind of guy who is willing to settle down. After all, he’s been known as one of Hollywood’s bad boys for years now. While no one knows exactly what is going on behind closed doors, there is some speculation that Norman might be hesitant to move forward at such a face pace on his end.</p><p>He’s got his hit television series, The Walking Dead, and is still the star of the show. Would he be willing to put everything on hold for his family? Some people think that might not be the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-they-moving-too-fast-too-soon><strong>Are They Moving Too Fast, Too Soon?</strong></h2><p>While it’s been reported that Norman Reedus and Diane Kruger have been dating under the radar for the last year and a half, the couple only started showing up on the red carpet together in recent months. Clearly, someone has an agenda here. As many people know, Diane loves being in the Hollywood spotlight. Norman, not so much.</p><p>The last time the couple got glammed up, Norman looked visibly awkward, as he had a look on his face that said he would rather be anywhere but where he was that night. Diane, on the other hand, was in her element.</p><h2 id=she-s-a-red-carpet-girl><strong>She’s A Red Carpet Girl</strong></h2><p>Truth be told, Diane Kruger is a Hollywood red carpet kind of gal. She loves fashion, she loves it when people are calling her name and most of all, she loves it when the cameras are pointing in her direction. It’s what she lives for. A lot of critics believe that it will only be a matter of time before Norman grows tired of the pressure to keep up with Hollywood’s standards on the red carpet. He’s just not cut up for that kind of work. Instead of rubbing with Hollywood’s elite, he would rather rub elbows with his fans at The Walking Dead conferences all throughout the country.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=norman-dislikes-the-spotlight><strong>Norman&nbsp;Dislikes The Spotlight</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned about, Norman Reedus hates the spotlight. He also hates the façade that a lot of people swear by in the entertainment industry. It’s no wonder that he avoids media interviews at all costs. He only talks to the press whenever has to. That’s because he doesn’t want people asking him personal questions about his private life. That topic is off limits. But now that he’s expecting a child with his girlfriend Diane Kruger, the media will try to ask him about his thoughts on fatherhood and raising a family. It’s something he simply won’t be able to avoid.</p><h2 id=raising-a-family-outside-of-hollywood><strong>Raising A Family Outside Of Hollywood</strong></h2><p>At least there is one thing that both Diane and Norman have in common: they want to raise their family outside of Hollywood. The German-born actress has said that she prefers to raise a family in Paris, France. Diane told The Edit, “I feel very European and I think that I’m going to grow old in Paris. I have this fantasy of raising my kids there one day. I just can’t imagine living my life sipping cocktails at the Chateau Marmont, you know? […] It took me a long time to realize that I’m never going to play a better part than my own life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=diane-s-expectations-for-her-future><strong>Diane’s Expectations For Her Future</strong></h2><p>Let’s face it: Diane Kruger is a Hollywood gal. She might not have A-list recognition like some of her counterparts, but she sure does know how to hold her own among Hollywood’s heavyweights. She’s earned plenty of respect and recognition for her work throughout the years. And now that Diane has Norman by her side, she might have the same expectations for him, too.</p><p>She might want him to “keep up” with the Hollywood pack, so to speak, despite his hesitation. Watch this space. A lot of critics agree that this is bound to get messy. Norman isn’t the kind of guy who will take orders.</p><h2 id=norman-s-laid-back-lifestyle><strong>Norman’s Laid-Back Lifestyle</strong></h2><p>If there is one thing that Norman Reedus loves, it’s just chilling out, hanging out at a bar somewhere in Barcelona, and just downing a few pints with his friends and his fans. He might be a huge television star and someone that people from all over the world recognize, but he’s also got a very laid-back lifestyle. Being an actor is nothing more than a job for him. He could quit it at any given moment and feel content over his decision. Clearly, Diane isn’t that kind of person. She still feels that she’s got so much more to prove in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keeping-the-baby-out-of-the-public-eye><strong>Keeping The Baby Out Of The Public Eye</strong></h2><p>If there is one thing Norman will strive to do, it’s keep his baby out of the public spotlight. Diane, despite her Hollywood fame, might feel the same way. The actress might look confident, but she says that’s not always the case. She once told The Edit, “I’m a loner. I think it has held me back in my life quite a bit. I’m socially awkward with people in a bigger group. People often say they think I’m cold or standoffish, but I’m just not a good schmoozer at all. And that’s not good in my job… because, obviously, it is a big requirement.”</p><h2 id=did-norman-receive-pressure-from-diane><strong>Did Norman Receive Pressure From Diane?</strong></h2><p>Now that Diane Kruger is pregnant, a lot of people believe that she might be pressuring Norman to give up his laid-back lifestyle and start thinking about raising the family and of course, having more stability in their lives. While no one knows what is going on behind closed doors for the couple, it’s pretty obvious though that both parties have different sets of expectations. As a matter of fact, the Diane Kruger of today seems totally different compared to the Diane Kruger of yesterday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Without sounding pessimistic, I don’t believe in marriage,” the actress admitted after divorcing Guillaume Canet in 2006, according to Star Magazine.</p><h2 id=will-there-be-a-marriage-proposal-next><strong>Will There Be A Marriage Proposal Next?</strong></h2><p>There’s a strong possibility that Diane might be hinting for Norman to put “a ring on it,” if you know what we mean. After all, the timing is absolutely right. Since they are about to have a baby together, they might as well get married soon too, right? Well, at least that’s what Diane might be leaning towards.</p><p>“Diane feels like she’s finally found her soulmate. A wedding is very much in the cards,” dishes an insider, according to Star Magazine. “She and Norman want something private and super romantic. They love the idea of getting married barefoot on the beach.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-is-what-diane-always-wanted><strong>This Is What Diane Always Wanted</strong></h2><p>Truth be told, Diane Kruger has made it no secret that this is what she’s always wanted in her life. She’s made it no secret that she’s always want to have a family, settle down and move away from Hollywood. And now that she’s pregnant, it does seem like her dreams are finally coming true. It’s only a matter of when things will happen in her favor. So far, the odds are looking good. With that being said though, no one ever would have thought that Norman Reedus would be settling down so late in his life and his career like this. Then again, anything can still happen.</p><h2 id=diane-s-issues-with-joshua-jackson><strong>Diane's Issues With Joshua Jackson</strong></h2><p>The timing of Diane Kruger’s pregnant has a lot of people asking the same question: what in the world happened during her relationship with her ex, Joshua Jackson? After all, they were together for more than a decade. And even though there were persistent rumors about an engagement, nothing ever happened. Clearly, Diane wasn’t happy in that relationship. Joshua wasn’t giving her what she wanted, when she wanted it, either. Of course, no one would have ever thought that Diane would move on with a guy like Norman, but here we are. Apparently opposites do attract, and especially in the Hollywood crowd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=norman-s-wild-lifestyle><strong>Norman’s Wild Lifestyle</strong></h2><p>Let’s face it: Norman Reedus is the kind of guy that is very difficult to hold down. Whatever Diane Kruger seems to be doing is working for now, but no one knows how long she’ll be able to keep Norman from doing what he does best, and that’s party until the sun goes down. Of course, things are about to change with their first child on the way. In fact, things should change. But you can’t erase decades of hard partying overnight. It’s going to take a lot of will power on Norman’s end to change things, especially if he wants to be a good father to his child.</p><h2 id=diane-s-self-awareness-and-insistence-on-getting-what-she-wants><strong>Diane’s Self-Awareness And Insistence On Getting What She Wants</strong></h2><p>Diane seems like a very self-aware person, and she knows exactly what she wants. After years in the industry, she has no interest in wasting time, and that might be why things are moving so quickly between her and Norman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Diane told The Edit, “I didn’t have a great private life until recently; I was always looking for the next thing. But when I turned 30, I realized I was being an idiot. I was living this accomplished life: I speak three languages, I’ve traveled the world, made good money. I realized that I really don’t know anything about what is going on in the world around me – and [I was] not so great about [knowing] myself, either… Now I’m not too self-centered!”</p><h2 id=they-are-just-too-different><strong>They Are Just Too Different</strong></h2><p>A lot of people are surprised that two people like Diane Kruger and Norman Reedus are dating for several different reasons. Sure, they might have one thing in common: they are celebrities in the entertainment industry. But with that being said, they come from two very different worlds.</p><p>Diane isn’t the hard partier that Norman is. She might be attracted to his edginess right now, but if he fails to deliver as a partner and a father, that might all fizzle out very quickly. She might not have the patience to deal with his late nights, especially if they continue to occur too often.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-norman-finally-settle-down><strong>Will Norman Finally Settle Down?</strong></h2><p>Here’s the million dollar question everyone is asking: will Norman Reedus finally settle down? After all, Diane has proven that she can adapt to changes. But what about Norman? Will he be able to take Diane’s lead once the baby arrives? That’s what everyone wants to know. After moving to New York, Diane told The Edit, "I just moved [to New York] this week. I need to unpack and buy some house stuff, like candles and books. [Moving here] was a major commitment. That’s a big step into adulthood for me, to allow that time for someone else out of my time.”</p><h2 id=norman-does-not-trust-the-media><strong>Norman Does Not Trust&nbsp;The Media</strong></h2><p>We’ve said this before and we will say it again: don’t expect Norman Reedus to somehow make a 180 and start talking about diapers and late nights with the baby anytime soon. That’s just not his style, nor will it ever be. Norman hates talking about things that he doesn’t have to talk about with the media. He’s strictly business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But now that he’s about to become a celebrity dad with Diane Kruger, it’ll be hard for him to avoid these kinds of questions. Fans can expect a lot of cringe-worthy moments in front of the cameras in the coming months.</p><h2 id=but-diane-loves-it><strong>…But Diane Loves It</strong></h2><p>But then again, Diane Kruger loves it. It’s without a doubt that she will be very open about motherhood and her new domesticated life with Norman, whether he likes it or not. She lives for this kind of stuff. Diane would rather talk about her hopes, her feelings, and her future with her new family than actually talk about a film that she’s supposed to promote at a press junket.</p><p>This is what she’s long been waiting for. It’ll be interesting to see how Norman will react to all of this new attention, though. We have a feeling that it won’t be very positive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-they-last><strong>Will They Last?</strong></h2><p>And with all of the above being said, a lot of people want to know: will Diane Kruger and Norman Reedus last? After all, Diane had enough patience to wait ten full years with Joshua Jacskon before pulling the plug on that relationship. But with a baby in the picture, it won’t be the same. There will be late nights. There will be pressure. And most certainly, there will be expectations. How do you feel about this? Will Norman Reedus and Diane Kruger last as a couple? Do they have a chance?
