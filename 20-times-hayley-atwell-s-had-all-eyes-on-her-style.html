She is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States.&nbsp; Her father is from Kansas City, Missouri. Hayley graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama with a degree in acting in 2005. She started her career with parts on a few BBC television productions. Hayley's first big break was on a miniseries, The Line of Beauty in 2006.</p><p>Hayley Atwell was first introduced to mainstream big budget audiences in 2011 as "Peggy Carter" in the film&nbsp;Captain America: The First Avenger.&nbsp;However, Atwell's acting career started long before that, with her first credited in&nbsp;Whatever Love Means. The film is set during World War II, and the subsequent TV series&nbsp;Agent Carter&nbsp;starts in&nbsp;1946. Western fashion in the late 1940's was heavily influenced by the war. Rationing of fabrics led to a fashion trend for simpler clothes. Women's clothing became more practical due to a large increase in women in the workforce. Therefore, plain, knee-length skirts and low heels were what women wore. Agent Peggy Carter is often seen in patriotic colors and functional attire, needed for fighting the bad guys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hayley Atwell's own fashion sense is evident in her off-screen garment choices as well.&nbsp; Hayley is not afraid to show off her natural curves and enjoys dressing up.</p><p>Continue reading below for 10 Times Hayley Atwell's Fashion Stole Our Hearts On Screen and 10 Off Screen.</p><h2 id=captain-america-the-first-avenger>Captain America: The First Avenger</h2><p>In&nbsp;Captain America: The First Avenger, the character of Peggy Carter wore various outfits from the wartime era.&nbsp; Her main one being a uniform. Carter's uniform was a boxy khaki military jacket, and skirt. Her makeup added a level of feminine appeal to her otherwise dark colored garb. During World War II, many women worked in factories and other physical jobs, and makeup allowed them to keep that womanly look. Staying pretty was seen as a patriotic duty, red lipstick and colorful nails were very popular.</p><p>In the film, Peggy Carter and Steve Rogers form a bond which evolves into a deep romantic connection.&nbsp; A connection that transcended separation, and time. Much like the style of Peggy Carter's wardrobe whether on the small screen or the big screen. The character of Peggy Carter has appeared in four Marvel films as well as multiple tv shows, including her own. She is also a character in the&nbsp;Lego Marvel's Avengers video game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=temptress-in-orange>&nbsp;Temptress in Orange</h2><p>Not many people can pull off this color, but Hayley certainly did. She wore the above curve hugging, sleeveless orange dress to the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala celebrating "Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty". The event was held in May 2011, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It celebrated the late Alexander McQueen's extraordinary contributions to fashion. His iconic designs showed expression through fashion. Something that Hayley Atwell whether on screen or off enjoys to do with her wardrobe.</p><p>The dress was custom made by Bally for Hayley.&nbsp; Its tan leather panelling accentuates her waist.&nbsp; This gorgeous gown shows off her natural curves. Atwell accessorized her stunning gown with a metallic, champagne clutch.</p><h2 id=flower-power>Flower Power</h2><p>Hayes may be a wild child, but she is also a lawyer and heading up the Conviction Integrity Unit, gives her the autonomy to select the cases that the team will investigate. The first case that she pushes for is that of a handsome former high school football player who has been in prison for eight years. Through scene-recreation, investigation of forensics and the original case detective, Hayes and her team are able to prove that the wrong man was in prison.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hayley Atwell worked with costume designer Carol Beadle to help imagine her character's wardrobe. The above pinstriped pants with red floral detailing and sheer blouse speak to the unwillingness of her character to completely conform to the conservative world, while accepting the need to be professional in her life. Her wild, confident style shines through in the details.</p><h2 id=little-navy-dress>Little Navy Dress</h2><p>Every girl needs a little black dress but what about a blue dress? Hayley rocked an amazing little navy number to present at an award show in 2015.&nbsp; The crisscrossed fabric across the chest was classy and feminine. The dress had sheer net details on the sides and leading down from her collarbone. Atwell completed the look with strappy black heels. She surely dazzled at the British Academy Film Awards, held at The Royal Opera House in London, England.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hayley did suffer some criticism from a slight wardrobe malfunction that was noticed on the arriving red carpet. The seam on her side under her left arm split thanks to the tightness of the dress combined with signing numerous autographs she gave to fans on her way to the red carpet. Hayley handled it with class, glamour and pose. Regardless of the snafu, she still strutted her stuff for the cameras and looked beautiful.</p><h2 id=conviction>Conviction</h2><p>In 2016, Hayley Atwell came back to the small screen as "Hayes Morrison", a former first daughter, on the short-lived series Conviction. Her character is a wild child and does everything except for what her mother asks of her. In the pilot episode, Hayes accepts a deal with the district attorney as opposed to jail time, to save face for both herself and her family. In the deal, Hayes agrees to head up the Conviction Integrity Unit. The unit was formed to right the wrongs of the justice system.</p><p>Hayes is asked to attend an event for her mother. She shows up to the event in a revealing form fitting red dress instead of the conservative black dress her mother selected. The red dress is absolutely stunning on Atwell. The look is completed with diamond jewelry, and a sleek updo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beautiful-in-blue>Beautiful in Blue</h2><p>For the 2012 BAFTAs, Hayley Atwell wore a stunning ivory and cornflower blue silk gown.&nbsp; She presented an award with fellow Marvel hero Chris Hemsworth. The William Vintage 1960's colour blocking dress looked ethereal on Atwell. Her look was completed with nude heels, gorgeous, ornate earrings, a blue and ivory cuff bracelet and gold clutch. Hayley was strong and confident in this amazing gown.</p><p>Hayley also stood up for women, expressing concern that there were no female actors on the short list for the "Rising Star Award". The longer list of eight included, Jessica Chastain, Felicity Jones and Jennifer Lawrence. She stated her concern while attending a pre-BAFTA's dinner at the St. Pancras Renaissance hotel in London. "We'd hope that gender doesn't really come into it and it's about the body of work that they produce that year, but it seems that hasn't been the case."</p><h2 id=angel-in-a-blue-dress>Angel in a Blue Dress</h2><p>Giovanna (Gigi) Ottobre-Melton was the costume designer behind the smart business suits, elegant evening gowns and stylish day to day dresses for the series Agent Carter. Gigi greatly wanted to be a part of the series, after hearing that it was going to be made. She loved the character of Peggy Carter and was excited about the possibility to design clothes for a female undercover agent. Gigi had been involved in the miniseries Mob City, which was set in the same era as Agent Carter. This provided her with a wealth of knowledge that she brought to her designs. Most of the outfits that we see Peggy wear are actual vintage pieces or are custom made for the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We first see the above dress midway through the first episode of the season two. It quickly became a fan favorite with its navy blue color and red stripes. Hemlines dropped to mid-calf postwar, as shone in this beautiful dress.</p><h2 id=crazy-for-this-jumpsuit>Crazy for this Jumpsuit</h2><p>Yet another classic look from Hayley Atwell.&nbsp; In 2016, Hayley attended ABC Upfront at David Geffen Hall in New York City.&nbsp; The annual event is held to present its fall lineup as well as show highlights from the prior season.&nbsp; Hayley was there representing her show Conviction.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the show was cancelled after two seasons due to low ratings despite the fact that it was well liked among viewers.</p><p>To the event Hayley wore a stunning, sophisticated, strapless black Takayama jumpsuit by SAFiYAA. This wide leg one piece features a full silhouette and a back zip closure.&nbsp; The fabric is composed of polyester and elastane. Unfortunately for trendy consumers, this jumpsuit quickly sold out online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Atwell's look was completed with soft makeup, loose locks and a black leather clutch.&nbsp; She looked both casual and classy in this ebony outfit.&nbsp; Hayley continues to show why she is a fashion icon.</p><h2 id=iconic-fedora>Iconic Fedora</h2><p>This is Peggy Carter's trademark look: a custom red ladies Stetson Stratoliner hat. In many of the promotional shots for the show Agent Carter, Hayley Atwell is wearing a different blue suit and a bold red hat. The hat is striped with the patriotic red, white and blue. The bold burst of color stands out amongst the grey fedoras worn by the working man. It was said in an episode by the character Butters, "Carter's superpower is the fact that other people underestimate her. And she often uses that to her advantage." Peggy finds herself doing administrative work when she first becomes an SSR Agent. This wardrobe piece is the most recognizable as for Peggy Carter.</p><p>Agent Carter, introduces the origins and storylines of several characters that from the Marvel Cinematic Universe film. Multiple other characters from the MCU films appear in the series as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, Agent Carter, did not make it past Season 2.</p><h2 id=self-portrait>Self-Portrait</h2><p>Hayley Atwell wore this fun and chic dress while attending at the Disney ABC Summer Press Tour in 2016 at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.&nbsp; Everywhere you look this dress has interesting detail.&nbsp; From the numerous lace designs, sleeveless arms, sheer netting, to the scalloped neckline, it is an eye catcher.&nbsp; The cutout in the back shows off flawless skin. Hayley completed her look light makeup, and a simple braided up-do. She chose to go sans jewelry and let her dress be both garment and accessory.</p><p>Some however didn't feel that this look was on point.&nbsp; In an article on&nbsp;Tom and Lorenzo it was said to "go off the rails around the knees", is "unnecessarily busy and distracting".&nbsp; Hayley's wide range and love of fashion often have her on the best dressed lists, though maybe not everyone's list.</p><h2 id=julia-flyte>Julia Flyte</h2><p>In 2008, Hayley Atwell played the part of "Julia Flyte" in the film,&nbsp;Brideshead Revisited,&nbsp;based on the 1945 novel of the same name by Evelyn Waugh. The film takes place during World War II in England. It is a story about love and loss of innocence. Two young men meet at Oxford, one being from a wealthy family and the other has no money. The story takes place in flashback after the main character is transferred with his military company to a mansion that he learns to be "Brideshead". The novel was first adapted for the small screen in 1981.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hayley's character is often draped in a silky kimono, fitting to her affluent family. Each and every wardrobe piece in the film is astonishing and breathtaking.</p><h2 id=2013-bafta-awards>2013 BAFTA Awards</h2><p>More than one actress wore a gown from designer Antonio Berardi on the red carpet for the 2013 BAFTA Awards held at The Royal Opera House in London. Both Sally Field and Hayley Atwell wore gowns from the renowned designer.&nbsp; The dress was from his fall 2012 collection and is very fashion forward. The elegant black and white look had paillette embroidery and a swirl pattern. It has rich textures and a layered peplum.&nbsp; This monochrome look was completed with a black clutch and wavy locks. Hayley's makeup was done by Shehla Shaikh, who created a soft romantic smoky eye with nude taupe shades, finished with rouge lipstick. Her hair was loose, unfussy and wavy, bringing a simplistic yet refined style to this decadent gown.</p><p>The gown hugged Atwell and accentuated her waist and curves.&nbsp; She exuded old Hollywood glamour and class. Hayley was a walking piece of art in this form fitting Antonio Berardi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=better-angels>Better Angels</h2><p>In Season Two Episode Three of Agent Carter, Peggy wears her signature navy blue and red with this short sleeve dress. The form fitting, fishtail dress has blocks of red trimming the collar, waistline, and angling down from the waist. This color play accents her curves and is sophisticated.</p><p>In this episode, audiences get to see Howard Stark for the first time since Captain America: The First Avenger. His assistance is key to Agent Carter finding evidence of a framing. Stark helps Peggy infiltrate the Arena Club by pretending that he wants to join, then forces the club to let in a group of young starlets as a distraction. It is in this episode we get one of Peggy's most memorable quotes when she is speaking to a cowardly Jack Thompson, when she says, "Burying an ugly truth and hoping someone will pin a medal on you." Carter's bold personality matches her wardrobe.</p><h2 id=classy-periwinkle>Classy Periwinkle</h2><p>This was at the&nbsp;inaugural <a href=#>Novak Djokovic Foundation</a> gala dinner, held at The Roundhouse in London in 2013.&nbsp; The foundation supports vulnerable and disadvantaged children, especially in Djokovic's native Serbia. Hayley sported a classic cocktail dress.&nbsp; This simple periwinkle fitted Safiyaa London dress was chic and paired with gorgeous nude heels. The dress had mid-length sleeves and a zipper on the back. Hayley was one of many celebrities including- Goldie Hawn, Kate Hudson, Naomi Campbell, Boris Becker and The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson. The stars were treated to a three-course dinner and a fundraising live auction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Novak Djokovic Foundation was created by famed Serbian tennis player, Novak Djokovic in 2007. The mission of the organization is to help children from impoverished communities to grow up and develop in stimulating environments.&nbsp; In 2015 Novak was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador to UNICEF.</p><h2 id=power-pinstripes>Power Pinstripes</h2><p>Peggy Carter has a very specific look in the television series. The character wears basically female versions of the suits worn by her male coworkers. Carter stands out from the rest of the office with her accessories and makeup. She is a very intelligent and skilled agent that must prove herself in a field made up by mostly men. A pilot episode was not ordered for the show, it was ordered straight off the bat as a series. Most television shows are initially ordered with a pilot first before the network will commit to a series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A majority of the time Peggy Carter is dressed in red, white and blue, a nod to her relationship with Captain America. This statement making dark blue pinstripe suit, brighter tone blue belt, and wide lapels, is a smart business suit for the office and feminine. It has an hourglass style with clean lines. Strongly tailored and defined shoulders add to the sleek look.</p><h2 id=women-in-film>Women in Film</h2><p>In 2012 at the Cannes Film Festival, Hayley Atwell wore this sultry red cocktail dress by Calvin Klein to an event celebrating Women in Film.&nbsp; Its Revlon Red color and soft, simple draping looked both casual and sophisticated. Hayley completed her look with a diamond tennis bracelet, black clutch and nude Sergio Rossi heels with a slight open toe. Hayley was attending Cannes Film Festival to promote the film&nbsp;Ten Things I Hate About Life. The movie was to be the sequel to&nbsp;10 Things I Hate About You, which starred Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon Levitt and the late great Heath Ledger. Unfortunately, the film was put on hold then cancelled after filming for about 7 months.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Independent Filmmaker Project, Calvin Klein and euphoria Calvin Klein celebrated women in film at a private villa, Villa St George, in Cannes, France. Several actors attended the event including, Diane Kruger, Naomi Watts, Shailene Woodley and Jessica Chastain.&nbsp; These stars along with others wore pieces from the Calvin Klein Collection.</p><h2 id=howard-s-end>Howard's End</h2><p>Following Conviction, Hayley Atwell appeared in a classic period piece, Howard's End. Preceding the series in 1992 was the film adaptation E.M. Forster's novel by the same name. The series focuses on the social and class divisions in the early 20th century England. In the television series Howard's End, Atwell played the part of "Margaret Schlegel". In an interview with Vogue Magazine, Hayley said, "I think she's one of literature's first feminists, she's someone whose moral compass is geared to connect with other people and to see them as human beings rather than just their social status. She finds people endlessly fascinating and wants to know as much about them as possible."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Atwell is definitely mesmerizing in this high collared, flowing, white and lacey dress. Margaret appears to be walking in a dream as the train of her dress flows over the grass. The costume designer for the show was Sheena Napier and she paid attention to the smallest detail for characters.</p><h2 id=jasper-conran>Jasper Conran</h2><p>For the 2013 Moet British Independent Film Awards, held at Old Billingsgate Market in London, Hayley wore a beautiful gown by Jasper Conran. The black sleeveless dress had a white Peter Pan contrast collar and a ball skirt. Atwell finished up her look with a white Jimmy Choo snakeskin clutch and Casadei shoes. Hayley was there to present the award for Best Actor. James McAvoy won the award and was greeted on stage with a hug from Atwell. Hayley shared presenting the award with Lesley Manville. She was very elegant on the red carpet before the event.</p><p>Hayley's fashion is unique to her and she pulls off form fitting frocks and flowing gowns. Atwell designed a pair of shoes inspired by her favorite book,&nbsp;To Kill a Mockingbird, and made by Upper Street.&nbsp; The heels were auctioned off for "Save the Children".&nbsp; The heels reflect her sassy fashion sense and love of the style trends from the late 1940's and early 50's.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Expect that any time Hayley Atwell graces the red carpet or the screen for her to do it in style.</p><h2 id=lady-in-red>Lady in Red</h2><p>In the Season Two&nbsp;opening of Agent Carter, "The Lady in the Lake", Peggy Carter moves to the City of Angels to help Chief Daniel Sousa an old friend investigate a strange case. Peggy learns that Howard Stark had also moved to the West Coast and was creating his own motion pictures. Carter meets Ana Jarvis, who creates the outfit in the above picture for Peggy to wear at the horse track, while she and Jarvis follow a lead.</p><p>With this move to a brighter Los Angeles instead of New York City, costume designer, Gigi, took inspiration from films like L.A. Confidential for the second season's fashion. This elegant, form fitting red dress shows a bit of skin through its cutout, trimmed in white and makes for a great dress to dance in. Peggy wears this fish tailed frock to the derby races.</p><h2 id=suzanne-neville>Suzanne Neville</h2><p>In October 2017, Hayley Atwell was a presenter at the 61st BFI London Film Festival, and she made heads turn in this knockout number. She led the glamour for the night in the Suzanne Neville gown with a halter-neck and very open keyhole. The dress teased a glimpse of her legs with a slashed feature. Hayley complimented the gown with natural makeup, jewelry from De Beers, and self-proclaiming her heels as "beautiful medieval-torture-foot-containers". She quickly added that she was grateful for them because they forced her to walk slow and sassy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a <a href=#>post</a> from her own instagram account <a href=#>@wellhayley</a> she said "Off to present at the BFI <a href=#>#londonfilmfestival</a> thank you <a href=#>@jennifer.michalski.bray.style</a><a href=#>@katrinrees</a> for making me look like this when inside I'm a just a flailing warthog."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKypobJwu81mmKecXaSzp3nSnKmenZ5if3F506Kknqtdna66uMSyZJqsp5q5rb%2BMoZidZZGhuW6x2J6qZqeeYrWmvoysq7KklWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-sarah-michelle-gellar-hated-season-6-of-buffy-the-vampire-slayer.html><span>←</span><span>Why Sarah Michelle Gellar Hated Season 6 Of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'</span></a>
