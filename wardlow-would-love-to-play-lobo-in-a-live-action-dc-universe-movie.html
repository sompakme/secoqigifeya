Wardlow is a noted Superman and comic book fan, and he says he’d love to follow in the footsteps of John Cena, Dave Bautista and others.</p><p>“Yeah, I think I absolutely would [consider acting],”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;“That’s something I think that’s always been in the back of my head. You see what John Cena, The Rock and Batista are doing, and it’s phenomenal. Then I gotta say, to be a part of the Marvel Universe or the <a href=# rel=noopener>DC Universe</a>. Oh my God, that would be a dream come true. That’d be an honor. I’d love to do that one day if the opportunity came up.”</p><p>Wardlow shared a few picks as to which superheroes (and supervillians) he’d love to play, noted that he’s a Shazam fan, but Lobo would be right up his alley too.</p><p>“Honestly, my third choice would have been Shazam. But they just recently did that and I think they’re doing another one. But I would have loved to portray Shazam. I’m just a kid at heart. I feel like it would be so easy to portray that on screen. Like, he’s this big monster, but he’s really just a kid with a big imagination. When I look at the villain side of things, I most definitely would love to play Lobo, and I used to have a Harley I loved riding. I love bikes, love riding. My Harley Davidson was my baby. And I enjoy a cigar here and there, so I feel like with Lobo,” he noted, “I would really be able to be super-in-tune with that character. Let’s get on it. Let’s get a live-action Lobo going.”</p><p>Wardlow <a href=#>will face off with MJF at AEW Double Or Nothing</a> on Sunday, May 29. He also recently spoke about feeling like his character is a mix of several notable characters from the silver screen.
