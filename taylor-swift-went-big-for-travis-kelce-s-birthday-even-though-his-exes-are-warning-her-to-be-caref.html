She arrived a day before the NFL star’s 34th birthday. On his special day, insiders told the outlet they opted to have a “chill night,” likely to avoid all the media attention around their budding romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, when Kelce and his fellow Kansas City Chiefs players then journeyed to Minnesota for their game on Sunday, October 8, Taylor appeared to have returned home. <a href=#>The NFL officially confirmed on Sunday that the popular singer was not present</a> at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis while the Chiefs competed against the Vikings.</p><p>However, she likely had other things on her mind, like the premiere of her new movie Taylor Swift: the Eras Tour. She was joined by Beyonce (plus a handful of other celebs) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at the world premiere for the film on October 11</a>, held at the Grove in Los Angeles.</p><p>Travis was noticeably absent from the premiere, as he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly stayed behind in Kansas to prepare for his game</a> on Thursday, which Taylor hasn’t confirmed if she’ll be watching from the audience.</p><h2 id=two-of-travis-rsquo-ex-girlfriends-have-cautioned-taylor-about-him>Two Of Travis’ Ex-Girlfriends Have Cautioned Taylor About Him</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar51804042-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Taylor and Travis appear to be head-over-heels for each other, the singer would have her reason to put distance between her and the athlete, <a href=#>given what Travis’ ex-girlfriends have recently said</a>.</p><p>Until last year, Travis was dating sports commentator Kayla Nicole. They dated on and off from 2017 to 2022, and faced allegations of infidelity during their time together.

I know I’m not alone and I want to make sure you know that you’re not either,” she wrote. “On days when I feel most inadequate, I have to remind myself that I am, have been, and will always be more than enough.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-s-most-quotable-lyrics-ranked-1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Most Quotable Lyrics Ranked, According To Reddit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Since the start of her career with Tim McGraw, and now with her 'Taylor's Version' albums, Swift has had some of the most quotable song lyrics.</span><p>Perhaps even more telling, Travis’ other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-girlfriend Maya Benberry spoke to Daily Mail </a>where she had a very clear message for Taylor, and wasn’t afraid to paint her ex in a poor light. “Taylor seems like such a fun girl with a beautiful spirit so I wish her the best of luck but I wouldn’t be a girls' girl if I didn’t advise her to be smart!” Maya said.</p><p>She began dating Travis in 2016 after winning the reality competition Catching Kelce, but she says things ended when she learned he was dating Kayla Cook at the same time.</p><p>“I’m sure by now she has mastered the ability to see who is really there for her - and who is just using her,” Maya went on. “I can only hope that she comes out the teacher in this situation and not the student.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The man that I knew him to be when we dated,” she added. “Only time will tell but like the saying always goes, once a cheater, always a cheater.”</p><p>Travis hasn’t responded to either Maya or Kayla’s comments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lk5q5pq7Rmqueq12pv6LCyKxkpJ2cmLK0ecGiqa2glJbGbq3FrZyrZZWteqi10aWdq6GVo7G0ecisqq6dXayus7rIp55o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-graham-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Graham Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
