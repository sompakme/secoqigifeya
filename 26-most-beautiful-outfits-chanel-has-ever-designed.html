Iconic, quintessentially French, and forever chic, Chanel is the designer label that all other brands look up to. Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel was the fashion house's founder. Unlike other big brands (think Givenchy, Louis Vuitton, or Gucci), Chanel hasn't had countless artistic directors. The current artistic director, Karl Lagerfeld has been the chief designer since 1983. Up until then, Coco herself was the brand's director. With just one person away from the iconic woman herself, Chanel is authentic as it gets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chanel is instantly recognizable. Little black dresses, woven colorful tweeds, and that signature costume jewelry will forever make Chanel the designer that fashionistas&nbsp; InstaSnap (and wish they could own). As the brand evolved, celebrities started stepping out in Chanel outfits. The fashion house's runways are now filled with Kendall Jenner and Cara Delevingne, and Chanel red carpet looks have been seen&nbsp;on Emma Stone and Chloe Grace Moretz looking absolutely stunning. With nearly one century of fashion history, it's time to look at Chanel more closely. Here are 26 of the most beautiful outfits Chanel has ever designed.</p><h2 id=the-one-karl-lagerfeld-paraded-around-himself><strong>THE ONE KARL LAGERFELD PARADED AROUND HIMSELF</strong></h2><p>While Karl Lagerfeld designs all of Chanel's outfits, only the finest are selected for the designer to actually stand next to. At the end of each fashion collection, Karl chooses his "bride" – the model or celebrity who will accompany him to close the show. In 2017, Karl stepped out with Lily Rose-Depp (who is now the face of Chanel no. 5 L'eau fragrance). Powder pinks, dreamy layers, puffed sleeves, and a dramatic train made up this exquisite haute couture gown – haute couture outfits are custom-made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-signature-chanel-fabric><strong>THE SIGNATURE CHANEL FABRIC</strong></h2><p>Rifling through a celebrity's wardrobe, you'll likely spot a lot of jackets. A Chanel fanatic will immediately spot the&nbsp;real Chanel ones from the rest, though. Lightly woven, pastel-shaded, and always a little "shabby-chic," the signature Chanel tweed is probably the biggest symbol that Chanel has. You're seeing it right here. Coco Chanel also came out with the kinds of quotes that Kim Kardashian could only dream of.</p><p><strong>"Whoever said money can't buy happiness didn't know where to go shopping." - Coco Chanel</strong></p><h2 id=some-famous-faces><strong>SOME FAMOUS FACES</strong></h2><p>Yes, it's Kendall Jenner. Chanel's artistic director, Karl Lagerfeld has somewhat fallen in love with his "muse," Kendall. She closed the haute couture fashion show in 2017 – closing a show is a huge honor. Here she is walking the runway past the Chanel Airlines setup at the Spring-Summer 2016 Ready-to-Wear collection in Paris. Kendall herself has called Karl a "legend," according to her Harper's Bazaar interview. "Iconic" was the other word she used, before adding: "I think legendary and iconic pretty much go together."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-grunge-look><strong>THE GRUNGE LOOK</strong></h2><p>Chanel has channeled so many looks, it's almost impossible to keep count. For the fall 2011 Ready-to-Wear collection, the vibe was decidedly grunge – with that distinct Chanel imprint, of course. Deep colors, daring blacks, workmen boots, and bleach blondes were the result, and the line was hugely successful. While Chanel is always girly, the look is always feminine-strong. Probably why Karl Lagerfeld chose Kristen Stewart to be his muse a few years back. "Energy should always be new" is one of Karl's most famous quotes.</p><h2 id=robot-wars><strong>ROBOT WARS</strong></h2><p>For a fashion house that is so classic, Chanel sure knows how to be futuristic. For the Spring-Summer 2017 collection, models walked a "data center" runway filled with LED displays, CCTV cameras, and a very robotic look to some of the outfits.</p><p><strong>"The robot," Karl explained, was meant to suggest that "Chanel is timeless."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Grand Palais in Paris (where the show is held) was transformed into a "Chanel data center" and the backdrop was control panels, multi-colored wires, and stark whites.</p><h2 id=yeezy-vibes><strong>YEEZY VIBES</strong></h2><p>The Chanel Spring-Summer 2018 fashion show was full of fashion's latest trend – plastic. Fashionistas were quick to spot the similarity between these knee-length perspex boots and Kanye West's Yeezy line – or any pic of Kim Kardashian wearing her husband's fashion line. These boots were all over the runway for the fashion house's latest collection, but they didn't draw away from the beautiful clothes. A Yeezy-style sneaker from Chanel is already available. The Chanel x Adidas x Pharrell retails for over $1300.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=summer><strong>#SUMMER</strong></h2><p>Floaty, feminine, slightly fancy, but never overdone – that's Chanel through and through. If you've got the money to splash out on a Chanel wardrobe, you're going to look good. Rihanna looked fresh-faced and lovely in this summery Chanel number as she stepped out into the street. While you might think that Rihanna is just another celebrity with a limitless budget and the time to shop, remember that the singer is herself fast becoming a respected designer. Rihanna's clothing and beauty lines are flying off shelves, and this girl knows her style.</p><h2 id=the-power-of-pastels><strong>THE POWER OF PASTELS</strong></h2><p>To think that one of Coco Chanel's earliest rivals called her clothes "Poverty deluxe." Chanel has risen to become one of fashion's biggest giants – for many, there is still nothing like Chanel. The fashion house itself has had many muses through the years. In the 90s, the supermodel, Claudia Schiffer was the poster girl for Chanel.</p><p><strong>The celeb fans? They're endless. Ariana Grande wears a Chanel purse. Kylie Jenner probably has 50.</strong></p><p>In recent years, Cara Delevingne, Keira Knightley, Tilda Swinton, Kristen Stewart, and Lily Rose-Depp have all been muses (plus Kendall Jenner).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=backstage-snapshots><strong>BACKSTAGE SNAPSHOTS</strong></h2><p>While the runway is where Chanel showcases its latest collections, backstage snaps like these really show the beauty of the clothes. The Ukrainian model, Snejana Onopka likely had no idea she was being photographed here, but when you're a model, you're a walking muse for the brand (both on and off stage). Chanel has definitely become a status symbol. Sofia Vergara has been spotted shopping at Chanel, as have Blake Lively, Hilary Duff, and Miley Cyrus. Ariana Grande is also often seen with her Chanel purses.</p><h2 id=so-very-chanel>&nbsp;<strong>SO VERY CHANEL</strong></h2><p>If you don't know much about the big designers, here are the basics. Versace is for the glittering, Vegas-style gowns that shimmer and wow. Gucci is for bold and classic Italian elegance. Calvin Klein is for NYC-style casual. Chanel? It's always a mix of slightly industrial, girly, effortlessly classy, and all the things that Coco Chanel felt that women represent. Coco Chanel was a working woman in a male-dominated industry. She did not mince her words.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous." - Coco Chanel</strong></p><h2 id=hitting-the-slopes><strong>HITTING THE SLOPES</strong></h2><p>Yes, there are Chanel skis. Only a fashionista like Victoria Beckham would brave taking the whole of Chanel with her while hitting the slopes. There's an air of exclusivity about Chanel, but if you've got the elegance (and the money), you can pull it off. When Elle interviewed Victoria Beckham in 2012, the celeb designer decided to hold the interview at 31, rue Cambon, the former home of Coco Chanel. "I love Paris and the French style," Victoria said. Chanel skis retail for around $4000.</p><h2 id=so-much-detail>&nbsp;<strong>SO MUCH DETAIL</strong></h2><p>This backstage shot was taken just as the models were preparing to walk the haute couture Chanel collection. Haute couture loosely translates to "high fashion" in French. What it really means, is that the clothes were hand-cut and custom-made. That contrasts with what you'd find walking into any designer store and shopping for yourself at the Ready-to-Wear collections.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Custom-made "haute couture" outfits can cost $20,000. And that's the starting price.</strong></p><p>Wearing haute couture is saved for the designer coming to fit you personally. Kendall Jenner closed the 2017 Haute Couture show at Chanel.</p><h2 id=ruffling-feathers><strong>RUFFLING FEATHERS</strong></h2><p>It's&nbsp;haute couture looks like these that will forever make Chanel fly the flag for timeless elegance. The haute couture show for this collection was an elaborate casino setup that saw models and actresses wearing custom-made Chanel around roulette tables. Kristen Stewart opened it, Kendall Jenner closed it, and the whole affair was one giant #class. Chanel isn't afraid to push the boundaries – those pixie cut wigs were definitely out there, but the dresses were stunningly beautiful. This Fall-Winter 2015/2016 gown was just part of the poker-inspired magic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=art-deco-style><strong>ART DECO STYLE</strong></h2><p>With Chanel, every collection out-does the previous one. For the Spring 2017 Haute Couture collection, the look was sharp while the backdrop was 100% Art Deco. Channeling the 1920s glitz of Paris (and Coco Chanel's era), the mirrored, angular finish was perfect for showcasing the collection's elongated lines, marabou-trimmed hems, and peach ostrich accents.</p><p><strong>"I wanted something impeccable, clean. I wanted the girls to look like walking fashion drawings."</strong></p><p>Karl Lagerfeld knew what he wanted for this collection. The circular runway was decked out in full Art Deco vibes, and the reviews were sensational.</p><h2 id=always-magical><strong>ALWAYS MAGICAL</strong></h2><p>One of the reasons that so many women love Chanel dresses – there's always that something "magical." Float-effect silhouettes, playful sleeves, or a laced neckline are the kind of angelic finishes that you can expect from many Chanel designs, although the price tags are a little less heavenly. Complete with kicky booties and a flower in her hair, the model, Lily Cole, looks like a veritable angel in this floaty white gown – the asymmetric cut is exactly what Karl Lagerfeld is about. With Karl, it's always modern, but always classic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=just-as-elegant-for-guys><strong>JUST AS ELEGANT FOR GUYS</strong></h2><p>High fashion can often leave menswear overlooked. Not at Chanel. The menswear collections are as much anticipated as the women's lines, and celebrities aren't afraid to put their faces to their favorite designers. Pharrell Williams channeled the androgynous Chanel look here at the 2016/2017 Chanel Collection des Metiers d'Art in Paris. Iconic bouclé tweed? Check. Shabby-chic fringed piping? Check. Sleek Chanel cut? Check. Pharrell has himself brought out an exclusive sneaker line with Adidas and Chanel. This is an artist who appreciates his fashion enough to show it.</p><h2 id=the-denim-archives><strong>THE DENIM ARCHIVES</strong></h2><p>Chanel is way too classy to have a full denim line. That's not to say that Karl Lagerfeld won't incorporate jeans into his collections, though. This&nbsp;is from 2008. Whether it was tailored jeans and denim tanks with elegant pearls, or bohemian ruffle necks with lace sleeves, Chanel denim got the full "trend" treatment&nbsp;for many of their shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"Let's see how many trends of the season we can tick off this time," Karl said for this look.</strong></p><h2 id=bubblegum-pink><strong>BUBBLEGUM PINK</strong></h2><p>When Chanel does pink, it gives Nicki Minaj a run for her money. In 2014, Cara Delevingne walked the Chanel runway in Yeezy-esque ripped pinks. In 2016, oversized checked pantsuits were mixing up greys and greens with the girly color. Chanel might be symbolized by classic monochromes, but the fashion house knows its pinks. Channeling the Chanel tweed with a playful dress look, this pink and white outfit has the boxy print, the funky hair, and the awesome pointed-toe boots.</p><h2 id=all-bundled-up><strong>ALL BUNDLED UP</strong></h2><p>Chanel definitely has an advantage when it comes to designing winter clothes that you can actually wear in cold weather. Versace? Not so much. The evening gowns haven't gone anywhere here, but this is an outfit that's finally meriting of its Fall-Winter title. The cozy bouclé tweed and wool looks might have a classic feel from the button-down jacket, but the arm warmers and headband are bang on-trend. This girl is marching into the cold with full Chanel back-up and she's looking sensational.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=black-velvet-brooding><strong>BLACK VELVET BROODING</strong></h2><p>Short hair, a piercing gaze, and an unconventional facial structure that has earned her a reputation as a beauty, Kristen Stewart was perfect for Chanel – not surprising then, that Kristen became Karl Lagerfeld's muse. Chanel's artistic director cherry-picked the actress for her fierce vibe and edgy mystery.&nbsp;There was nothing unclear about the #GirlPower at this haute couture show, though. Kristen wore a black velvet pantsuit that did away with the fuss and focused on feminine beauty, clean lines, and the signature Chanel edge.</p><h2 id=featherweight-stripes><strong>FEATHERWEIGHT STRIPES</strong></h2><p>This is so Chanel, it hurts. The feathered wool look has been a Chanel emblem for decades. Classic as it is, the fashion house isn't afraid to use the entertainment industry's most relevant faces. Kaia Gerber is the model here. She is the daughter of the 90s supermodel, Cindy Crawford. Kaia already has 3.5 million Instagram followers. The famous daughter deal is a pattern at Chanel – Lily Rose-Depp is the current face of Chanel. Her mom, Vanessa Paradis, did the same while she was with Johnny Depp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-famous-sister-at-a-time><strong>ONE FAMOUS SISTER AT A TIME</strong></h2><p>It isn't up-to-date fashion without a sister duo. In 2016, Chanel chose the famous model sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid for its haute couture show. Under a blue sky backdrop, the sisters showcased Chanel's collection on a grass floor.</p><p><strong>Gigi and Bella Hadid have walked as a sister duo for Chanel on multiple occasions. Kendall Jenner joined them for this haute couture show in 2016.</strong></p><p>This was the same year that Kendall and Gigi walked for Victoria's Secret in Paris. They headed straight to a burger joint after.</p><h2 id=the-store-window-you-ll-always-recognize><strong>THE STORE WINDOW YOU'LL ALWAYS RECOGNIZE</strong></h2><p>Walking down the designer boulevards of the world's fashion-centric cities, you can easily get lost between the various stores. Louis Vuitton, Prada, Valentino, Saint Laurent, and Versace are all tightly packed on one street. Chanel? You'll always recognize it. With a chic and understated storefront and an iconic Chanel tweed look invariably in the window, a fashionista will always find her bearings near a Chanel store. Chanel has flagship stores in London and Paris. For the authentic experience, it's worth just walking past the store in Paris.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-very-royal-fanbase><strong>A VERY ROYAL FANBASE</strong></h2><p>You know you've made it to the top in high fashion when the royals are wearing your collections. Kate Middleton was head-to-toe in Chanel during her 2017 trip to Paris, where she channeled the Duchess look, Chanel style. The multi-color tweed dress was perfect for Kate's "royal-appropriate" look, although it's likely that the dress sold out within minutes of Kate being photographed in it. Kate honored her visit to the French capital by wearing the country's most iconic designer – Chanel.</p><h2 id=the-man-behind-it-all><strong>THE MAN BEHIND IT ALL</strong></h2><p>It's hard to believe that the entire Chanel empire is relying on one man, but it is. Karl Lagerfeld took over as Chanel's artistic director in 1983. He has been single-handedly running the fashion house ever since. Karl himself is somewhat of a fashion icon. Instantly recognizable in his all-black wardrobe, slick jackets, and shades, Karl is a designer that most fashionistas consider as "the best there is." His Fendi line is worn by every Kardashian around, and at the age of 84, Karl is still going strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-chanel-legacy><strong>THE CHANEL LEGACY</strong></h2><p>In many ways, Chanel was a legacy from the minute Coco Chanel designed her first outfit. While some of Chanel's most iconic designs have been elaborate gowns, it's simplicity like this that earmarks Chanel's ever-lasting edge. Kendall Jenner looked like a dream in this off-white satin bridal pantsuit, complete with a long train.</p><p><strong>Kendall Jenner closed this haute couture show as Karl Lagerfeld's "bride."</strong></p><p>If you've got a Facebook friend who lives for fashion, hit share for them. If they're a Chanel fan, expect to get a lot of thank-yous. If you yourself are all about Chanel, it's time that your friends started appreciating true fashion.
