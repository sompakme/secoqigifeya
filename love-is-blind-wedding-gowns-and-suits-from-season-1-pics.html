Within 10 days, six couples got engaged, but only five stayed together until their wedding ceremonies, which took place just 38 days after the singles met for the first time.</p><p dir=ltr>So when the show's stars decided to pop the question, they turned to producers to supply them with a diamond sparkler. According to an interview with series creator Chris Coelen via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, the men got to choose a ring for their loved one of just over a week, without ever seeing her in real life.</p>[ami-related id="1714953" url="https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/best-celebrity-engagement-rings-of-2020-details/" title="Celebrity Engagement Rings of 2020: See All the Diamonds and Bling" target="_blank" showsubt="false" thumb="false" imgsrc="https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alex-Guarnaschelli-Emerald-Engagement-Ring-Promo.jpg"]<p dir=ltr>"Once they decided to get engaged, they were given a couple of choices, should they want to take us up on that,” Coelen told the outlet.
