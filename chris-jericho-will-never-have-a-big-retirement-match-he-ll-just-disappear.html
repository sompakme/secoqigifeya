Even now, The Ocho is en route to becoming an AEW World Tag Team Champion.</p><p>Recently, <a href=#>Jericho</a> was a special guest on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Insight With Chris Van Vliet</a> podcast. During the episode, Van Vliet asked if Chris Jericho would consider having his final match against Lance Storm. It was because the very first match Jericho had was against Lance Storm. The Ocho said he had one idea for that match, but doesn’t think he’d actually announce his retirement match.</p><p>“Yeah, I had an idea. It was probably three or four months ago, where I was like, ‘Hey dude on this date, we should go to rent out the hall where we had our first match. And then have the exact same match again. Like the same spots, the same everything. And I thought that kinda was interesting but then I once again, like you know, the worst thing you could do is put a expiration date on your career.</p><p>“Becuase, if you feel like you want to do it, I remember the Scorpions went on a retirement tour like I don’t know, ten years ago or something. It’s like, why are you putting that much pressure on yourself? And then decided, ‘Nay, we don’t want to retire. We are having so much fun.’ And there’s like just don’t ever say that. If you’re gonna do it, then do it. And for me, like I’ll never have the big retirement match and I don’t… I hate that sh*t. I’ll just f*cking disappear, man. And that will be the best way to do it,” Chris Jericho said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNrbmpsaWKwqb7IrGSjnaKesKm7jKecr52iYr%2BmwMirnKadnql6rq3TnJ8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brittany-matthews-defends-jackson-mahomes-after-drama.html><span>←</span><span>Brittany Matthews Defends Jackson Mahomes After Drama</span></a>
