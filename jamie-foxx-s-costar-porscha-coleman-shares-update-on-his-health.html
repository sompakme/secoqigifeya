The actress went on to say that she’s not surprised her colleague has kept his condition close to the vest, noting that he’s always valued his privacy.</p><p>“If you’ve noticed, Jamie Foxx has always been on the low,” Coleman said. “Even when it came to dating, Jamie’s always been private, so it never surprised me. Once I heard the news, of course, I reached out, but how Foxx is doing it is how Foxx should be doing it. He’s resting, he’s well. And he’s going to be back. Trust and believe.”</p><p>Earlier this year, the Oscar winner’s daughter Corinne, 29, revealed that <a href=#>her father was hospitalized</a> after a medical emergency. “We wanted to share that my father, Jamie Foxx, experienced a medical complication yesterday,” she said in a statement on April 12. “Luckily, due to quick action and great care, he is already on his way to recovery. We know how beloved he is and appreciate your prayers. The family asks for privacy during this time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jamie-Foxxs-Costar-Porscha-Coleman-Gives-Update-on-Actor-2-Months-After-Health-Scare-Hes-Well3.jpg><p>Foxx shares Corinne with ex <strong>Connie Kline</strong>.

The rep said the rumor was “completely inaccurate” in a statement to NBC News.</p><p>At the time of his hospitalization, Foxx was in production on the upcoming movie Back in Action, which also stars <a href=#><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kyle Chandler</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Glenn Close</strong></a>.
