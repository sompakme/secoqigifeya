Amen.”</p><p>Griffin chimed in and said it was “a miss” for the Academy to leave out Rivers. “She was in feature films and it was an odd miss,” Griffin reflected. “It’s almost like even posthumously, she’s still a rebel.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Joan’s daughter <strong>Melissa Rivers</strong>, the executive producer of Fashion Police, made a more measured statement about her mother’s absence from the segment <a href=#>via Facebook</a> on Monday. “It would have been nice, especially considering the impact she had on the awards season,” Melissa wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Academy, for its part, attempted to explain why Rivers was left off the In Memoriam segment. Rancic, however, was less than pleased with the Oscars’ treatment of Rivers overall. “Let’s all blame them,” Rancic said on Monday’s Fashion Police. “Let’s blame them for everything!”</p><p>One thing for certain that Rancic cannot blame the Academy for her remarks about Zendaya’s hairstyle at the Oscars on Sunday, Feb. 22. The E! News host <a href=#>had to apologize</a> to the talent after she said Zendaya probably smelled “like patchouli oil… or maybe weed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagoaWhtqK6wGapmqaTnrBussuip6xlpJ2ybq7Iq5tmmaRirqStw56ksmWWpL9uts6apWaqmauys7%2BMqKqcmaKoerS61Jtka2hhan91fo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-grazer-net-worth-how-much-is-grazer-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Brian Grazer Net Worth How Much is Grazer Worth?</span></a>
