He revealed he was battling cancer last May, but kept many details hidden from the public, including the type. His last public appearance came in January when photographers spotted him walking with a cane.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since his passing, some bizarre accusations have come out about O.J. While his net worth was reportedly depleted by the time of his death, largely due to years of legal battles, one of his friends claimed he’d hidden millions of dollars in offshore accounts to avoid paying the family of his ex-wife and her lover, Rob Goldman.</p><h2 id=o-j-rsquo-s-friend-claims-he-hid-100-million>O.J.’s Friend Claims He Hid $100 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/oj-simpson-1.jpg><p>An audio recording, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired by The U.S. Sun</a>, exposes a conversation where Simpson's long-time associate Bruce Fromong acknowledged assisting the controversial athlete in establishing "offshore accounts." Apparently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it may amount to over $100 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fromong and Simpson share a complicated history. Despite their friendship, Simpson infamously robbed Fromong at gunpoint in 2007 at the Las Vegas Palace Station, resulting in Simpson's incarceration.</p><p>This incident occurred more than a decade after Simpson's acquittal of the murders of Brown and Goldman. Fromong testified against Simpson during his 2008 trial but later advocated for Simpson's 2017 parole release, expressing forgiveness towards him.</p><p>Even after his exoneration in the murder trials, Simpson encountered a wrongful death civil lawsuit initiated by the Goldman and Brown families. This legal battle resulted in the court deciding Simpson would have to remunerate $33.5 million in damages, a sum that escalated over time due to accruing interest.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:13</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/khloe-kardashian-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Khloe Kardashian And OJ Simpson Relationship Questioned Again Soon After News Of His Death">Khloe Kardashian And OJ Simpson Relationship Questioned Again Soon After News Of His Death</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>When O.J. Simpson passed away in April 2024, people began discussing a long-standing rumor about the athlete and Khloe Kardashian.</p><p>Simpson allegedly never fulfilled the financial obligation, though the families did benefit from the profits of Simpson's contentious 2007 book, If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Fromong’s claims, Simpson is reported to have died with significantly less in his bank account. He apparently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had a net worth of $3 million at the time of his death</a>, which was much lower than it had been in the past.</p><p>At one point, it was estimated to be $38 million, though this still isn’t as high as the hundreds of millions Fromong claims he once was in possession of.</p><p>In his final years, Simpson reportedly made an annual income of $42,000 from Social Security, augmented by a pension from the Screen Actors Guild. Plus, he had a substantial NFL pension ranging between $125,000 to $300,000. His four surviving children are expected to inherit his fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimo2Wjnrqxv86nqmabkarApnnDnpitoF2YvK%2ByyKuknpxdlrCkwdKem2agmZm2r7OMpqClpJmku7R7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-maria-duncan-flores-nationality-instagram-age-wikipedia-and-parents-of-brian-flores-w.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Maria Duncan Flores Nationality, Instagram, Age, Wikipedia And Parents Of Brian Flores W</span></a>
