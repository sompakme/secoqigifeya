The Death Row Records founder, who is currently serving a prison sentence stemming from a manslaughter conviction, spoke of alleged public displays of affection shown amongst that particular group.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Once they start painting they fingernails and wearing women’s clothes, they got you,” Knight said of his antagonists. He also recalled instances in which Diddy received lavish gifts from the late Andre Harrell and rapper The Game that gave him cause to pause.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-465683854.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I remember when they was giving Puffy an award at the ASCAP Awards — Andre went up there and got him an expensive watch and gave it to him in front of everybody. He basically confessed his love to this man,” the legendary mogul said. “Then Puffy and Snoop <a href=#>became besties</a>. Every time you see one, you seen the other one. Next thing you know, they start painting they fingernails. Didn’t make sense.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Knight continued, “[The] Game bought Puffy a Lamborghini when Puffy got more money than Game. Why you buying this man a Lamborghini? You know your homies don’t even got a Lamborghini. But once again, it’s that secret society. For this thing to work and fix it, they gotta start all the way over in these major record labels and these big buildings. They need to get rid of all the guys who was connected to the poison and the snake.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Upon catching wind of Knight’s claims, Snoop Dogg <a href=#>issued a response</a> by simply reposting an AllHipHop report of the embattled mogul’s allegations along with a laughing emoji and a shrugging emoji, seemingly expressing his humor and bewilderment regarding his former CEO’s assertion.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See Snoop Dogg’s response to Suge Knight below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-14-at-07.40.52.webp><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6i7sLvPZpuon5diwLazxGaip6GXncFuv8ScqZ6sXai8pLXErbBmaWJogXmCj3BwbWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scott-hall-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Scott Hall Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
