She’s an amazing talent, and it’s exciting to just be able to branch out.</p><p>“I’m not gonna use all the cliched terms about what door people go through, anything like that because it’s stupid and silly. But partnerships and opportunities like this come along for some people once in a lifetime. I’m glad she had that opportunity. It’s well-deserved, she’s an incredible talent.”</p><p>During the press conference, Triple H said he wanted to focus on the positives when asked about the lawsuit against Vince McMahon.
