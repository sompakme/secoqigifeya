But now there are so many luxury yoga pant brands that those days are a thing of the past. Hollywood actresses are absolutely as in love with yoga pants as normal women of the world are, so we’re not surprised that the paparazzi have captured tons of starlets in their spandex wear out and about around Los Angeles and New York City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since most women who don the silver screen can be considered sexy we’re sure that you’ll find this compilation of Hollywood’s most beautiful starlets strapped into their tightest spandex yoga pants. Whether they’re going to the gym or picking up some stuff for dinner at the store before heading home; these actresses look right at home in their yoga leggings.</p><p>Being followed around by paparazzi 24/7 surely isn’t an easy thing to deal with, but being comfortable in yoga pants seems to keep these starlets calm under pressure. Some of the most popular women for men’s mag lists like FHM and Maxim’s sexiest and hottest woman alive lists making them definitely worth checking out in yoga leggings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eva-longoria><strong>Eva Longoria</strong></h2><p>After getting her start on soap opera The Young and the Restless in 2001 it was just a short time before the world noticed petite star, <a href=#>Eva Longoria</a>. Several publications have referred to the actress, producer, businesswoman, and activist as one of the most beautiful people in the world and because of this, she is part of a few worldwide advertising campaigns for large corporations.</p><p>Before becoming a famous actress, Longoria was born to a Mexican-American family in Texas where she studied and had a job at a fast food chain before getting her bachelor's degree in Kinesiology from Texas A&M University - Kingsville.</p><p>While in college, Longoria won a pageant which is how she found her way to Los Angeles to be discovered by a talent agent. The drop dead gorgeous star was quickly scooped up to become one of the hottest leading ladies on primetime in Desperate Housewives.</p><h2 id=eva-mendes><strong>Eva Mendes</strong></h2><p>This model and actress is an international brand ambassador as well as a movie star who has been in the public eye since doing B-movies in the 90’s. Mendes grew up in Glendale, a suburb of Los Angeles, and was discovered by accident in the background of a friend’s portfolio photo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress is frequently voted one of the hottest or beautiful women in the world and was even named People magazine’s 2012 Most Beautiful People at Any Age and appeared on the cover of Maxim twice by 2007. In 2011 <a href=#>Mendes </a>starred in The Place Beyond the Pines with Hollywood heartthrob Ryan Gosling and the two got along. They got along so well that the pair has been together since then and now have two daughters together: Esmeralda Amada and Amada Lee.</p><p>This photo was taken professionally, presumably for one of her many national ad campaigns for various clothes and cosmetics.</p><h2 id=jenny-mccarthy><strong>Jenny McCarthy</strong></h2><p>Since her first days on MTV’s Singled Out in the 90’s and regularly gracing the centerfold of Playboy men’s magazine McCartney has truly evolved. <a href=#>McCarthy</a> always had a way about her that flawlessly combines sexuality and comedy which only she can truly pull off to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then she has really reshaped her career which, aside from this awesome photo of her in yoga pants, isn’t based much on her awesome body. She is a loud and proud anti-vaccine activist that spent a year as a talking head on popular daytime talk show The View. Her time on the view was protested by many who disagreed with her stance on vaccines causing autism.</p><p>McCarthy credits dealing with her son’s autism as one of the main reasons that she and her husband divorced and since then has been featured on a Larry King Live! Episode speaking out about vaccines and their link to children with autism.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></h2><p>The American actress was discovered at the age of 14 in New York City but was raised in Kentucky during most of her childhood. When she first hit Hollywood fame <a href=#>Lawrence</a> was beloved immediately for her ‘girl next door’ charm. In 2012 she was named “the most talented young actress in America” by Rolling Stone magazine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has also been in popular men’s magazines as one of the sexiest actresses in Hollywood and at one time was named one of People magazine’s ‘Most Beautiful People’ along with some other accolades. Lawrence is also a major activist for women’s rights and supporter of Planned Parenthood.</p><p>She is also one of the actresses that first spoke out against the gender pay gap in Hollywood among leading men and leading ladies. This photo was captured by paparazzi while Jennifer Lawrence is in casual clothes, but she still looks absolutely amazing in her super tight yoga pants.</p><h2 id=kate-beckinsale><strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong></h2><p>Films like Much Ado About Nothing and Pearl Harbor helped us all fall in love with British actress <a href=#>Kate Beckinsale</a>. Since she was a girl in England Beckinsale was involved with youth theater and even won awards for poetry and fiction. During her first film (Much Ado About Nothing) she was actually still a student at Oxford, prestigious English University. Looking at this photo of Beckinsale in skin tight yoga pants it’s no surprise that she has modeled on top of her acting work. The actress starred opposite Hollywood hottie</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress starred opposite Hollywood hottie <a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a> in a Gap television ad in 2002 that was directed by award winning <a href=#>Cameron Crowe</a>. She continues to get acclaim for valuable roles and recently starred in Love & Friendship the Jane Austen comedy which garnered Beckinsale much attention. Aside from being ridiculously attractive Beckinsale is fit and appears in just as many action films as she does romantic comedies.</p><p>Aside from being ridiculously attractive Beckinsale is fit and appears in just as many action films as she does romantic comedies.</p><h2 id=megan-fox><strong>Megan Fox</strong></h2><p>Appearing in publications like FHM, Maxim, Rolling Stone, and other popular men’s magazines garnered her tons of attention and set herself firmly into Hollywood culture. As one of the modern female sex symbols of our age, she has been compared quite frequently to <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>, to which the actress and model always scoffs. After her first role in an Olsen twins film, Fox blew onto the scene starring in television roles before first getting her spot in the Michael Bay summertime smash hit Transformers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She actually starred in the first two films opposite <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf</a> before bowing out to what turned into a franchise that’s still producing smash hits. Lately, Fox hasn’t been seen doing much in Hollywood but it’s probably because she’s had three boys with husband <a href=#>Brian Austin Green</a>. The pair has been dating since 2004 and married in 2010 before having their boys. Children or not</p><p>The pair has been dating since 2004 and married in 2010 before having their boys. Children or not <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> remains comfortable among the hottest women in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=emma-stone><strong>Emma Stone</strong></h2><p>The fiery redhead&nbsp;is transitioning from quirky teen to leading lady and as such has been working’ those glutes, as seen in this photo of <a href=#>Stone</a> pumping gas in yoga leggings. The actress has been drawn to the craft since she was small growing up in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though she was homeschooled and couldn’t get involved with school theater Stone was featured in tons of plays through Phoenix’s Valley Youth Theater including The Princess and the Pea, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.</p><p>In 2004 Stone presented her parents with a PowerPoint slideshow that convinced her mom to move with her to Los Angeles and pursue an acting career. She tried out for every Disney channel show that she could and was turned down for every single one. Her feature film debut was in Superbad which helped her rise to some success, but she was thrown over the top with her spot in House Bunny opposite hilarious actress and fellow hottie Anna Faris.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis><strong>Mila Kunis</strong></h2><p>The beloved American actress is clearly not trying to be photographed in her Lululemon yoga as she keeps her head down, but we're sure you still think she looks amazing. Before her 15th birthday, <a href=#>Kunis</a> got her first huge role as Jackie on popular Fox primetime series That '70 Show which aired for eight years. On the show, she dated a character played by <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>, an actor who is now married to the starlet. The pair started dating in 2012, four years after wrapping on That '70s Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two years later they were engaged and by now they’ve had two kids. Kunis was named ‘Knockout of the Year’, ‘Hottest Woman of All Time’, ‘Sexiest Woman Alive’, and more by popular men’s magazines which has only solidified her fame.</p><p>In November 2011 Sgt. Scott Moore posted a YouTube video that he wanted Mila Kunis to come with him to the United States Marine Corps Ball in Greenville, North Carolina and she accepted, the event celebrated the 236th anniversary of the Marine corp.</p><h2 id=jessica-alba><strong>Jessica Alba</strong></h2><p>After landing a couple of roles in movies and Nickelodeon shows when she was just 13 <a href=#>Alba</a> knew that she could make it in Hollywood. Her real breakout role was in Dark Angel, a <a href=#>James Cameron</a> television show. She’s starred in some films which have given her the attention necessary to achieve the status that she has today. This capture was taken by paparazzi while the star was on the go and features her extra fit figure in her spandex workout ensemble.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica Alba is often on the hottest lists and was named one of People magazine’s most ‘Beautiful People at Any Age’ list that came out in 2012. While her acting career has petered somewhat she has co-founded successful venture The Honest Company which makes non-toxic home cleaning products.</p><p>The star owns 15-20% of the company and advocates for a healthy, non-toxic lifestyle both for our families and the environment.</p><h2 id=kristen-stewart><strong>Kristen Stewart</strong></h2><p>Landing a role opposite <a href=#>Jodie Foster</a> in the film Panic Room was a huge opportunity for young <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> and her part in the film actually earned her a few awards. The real breakthrough for the actress was landing the role of Bella in the tragic teen movie series Twilight which earned an enormous fan base. Starring in Adventureland (2009) and The Runaways (2010) where she played Joan Jett from famed 80’s band The Runaways. During her</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her Twilight days, Stewart was rumored to be in a relationship with her costar <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> until the end of the saga was filmed, wrapped, and distributed. Since that relationship, Stewart has been rumored to be romantically involved with her former female assistant Alicia Cargile after stirring up a bit of controversy.</p><p>This photo features the complete backside for Kristen Stewart as she waits to enter a friend’s house while adorned in skin tight yoga pants.</p><h2 id=anne-hathaway><strong>Anne Hathaway</strong></h2><p>This Academy Award winner rose to stardom after acting in modest theater troupes throughout her childhood. Her role in The Princess Diaries got her noticed for her eloquent and immersed acting skills in her teens. She next starred in Ella Enchanted before making it easy to transfer into adult roles with her work in The Devil Wears Prada opposite, <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her other big adult role in 2005's Brokeback Mountain, a choice that surprised critics in the most delightful way. This serious, heavy role was played with grace and <a href=#>Hathaway</a> had officially entered the A-List. The usually brunette actress is pictured here with blond, short hair on her way to the gym in yoga pants that look just like the sky.</p><p>Staying in good shape is part of your job in Hollywood and Hathaway maintains a healthy, active lifestyle.

She got her first role as Mary Camden on the longest running family drama 7th Heaven.

They have one child together, Silas Randall Timberlake.</p><h2 id=olivia-wilde><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong></h2><p>This actress is best known for playing popular character “Thirteen” on now finished television show House. She has starred in tons of television and film before and after her role on House.</p><p>This year <a href=#>Wilde</a> was cast as the wife of eccentric record executive in HBO original series Vinyl. She took her name from writer Oscar Wilde and chose to change her name as an homage to the many writers in her family that did the same. Her wildly good looks and keen acting talents have fueled a somewhat prominent acting career and a very active love life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November of 2011, Wilde began dating funnyman <a href=#>Jason Sudeikis</a> and the pair got engaged two years later.
