While reminiscing about her teenage years, the actress <a href=#>told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;exclusively</a> which of her kisses from that era was the best —&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Adrian Grenier</strong></a>.</p><p>“He was the most fun,” the&nbsp;Melissa & Joey&nbsp;alum said in September 2016. “We had a blast together on&nbsp;Drive Me Crazy. And he’s a good kisser!”</p><p>The ‘90s gave TV viewers&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar</strong></a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, but also led the actress to her forever love with fellow ‘90s star,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Freddie Prinze Jr.</strong></a>&nbsp;The couple, who wed in 2002, met on the 1997 set of&nbsp;I Know What You Did Last Summer&nbsp;and <a href=#>bonded on a road trip in North Carolina</a>.</p><p>“She didn’t have a driver’s license. She didn’t know how to drive,” the&nbsp;<a href=#>She’s All That</a>&nbsp;star exclusively told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in April 2020. “So, I started driving her, and that’s when her and I became friends. And we just would talk about life and stuff like that, and we had completely different philosophies on just about everything.”</p><p>By the end of filming, the two had a friendship rooted in driving and food. “I just wanted to be friends with her because I thought she was too skinny and I wanted to cook for her,” the California native explained. “So, we started this weekly barbecue thing at her house, and me and my cousins would come over and cook food for her and her friends. And then we’d make sure everybody ate, and that was kind of how our friendship began.”</p><p>The couple’s longtime pal,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Selma Blair</strong></a>, is one of the many film stars from the era to continue to impress in Hollywood.&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Winona Ryder</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Christina Ricci</strong></a> have also evolved since their ‘90s hits.</p><p class=p1>“I mean there’s so many positives with both [film and TV] and a few negatives,” Ricci<a href=#> exclusively told <i>Us&nbsp;</i>in October 2022</a>. “I like doing TV because you kind of get to spend a longer time with the character, and if you do like the character, then that’s fantastic and great. And then I do like movies as well because you do have this beginning and end and a really in-depth understanding of who it is you’re playing. And so that’s sort of like a warm security blanket, but TV’s not like that. I’m right now growing and learning and changing and developing new muscles. And I do like that about TV that even at my age when I’ve been doing this for 35 years, it’s forcing me to grow and develop new skills.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>TV wise,&nbsp;Home Improvement’s&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Jonathan Taylor Thomas</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Full House</a>’s&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong></a>&nbsp;are among the standouts who are still taking the entertainment industry by storm.</p><p>Scroll down to see what some of the other ‘90s stars have been up to over the past few decades.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq19ufbR50q2Yq6tdqbWmuoyapZ1lnqTEbsOTbGlybmhk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ron-offutt-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Ron Offutt Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
