Beautiful people who love to get into tricky situations – what’s not to love about that?&nbsp;Some WWE stars have been known to <a href=#>sleep around without their partner’s consent</a>, and others have dabbled in drugs and alcohol to numb the chaos of their celebrity lifestyle. But there’s always another direction a few rogue stars travel in – the adult entertainment industry.</p><p>The world of television and film can be a hard industry to survive in. Stars fall in and out of favor faster than we can keep up. One minute you could be on top of the world with a hefty paycheck in the mail, and then next you’re getting a pink slip and struggling to pay your rent. There’s really only been one industry that’s survived the test of time, and that’s the world of adult entertainment. When in doubt, sex always sells.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is a list of 15 different WWE stars that all got caught with their pants down to fill deep pockets. There’s no shame in the game! Some stars had years of experience under their belts, others indulged in sexy films on a one-off, and others had footage leaked that they never intended anyone to see. Be prepared to be shocked – you’ll never be able to think of these celebs the same way again!</p><h2 id=15-lizzy-borden><strong>15. Lizzy Borden</strong></h2><p>Between adult entertainment gigs, Lizzy was known to participate in wrestling entertainment. Similar to that of <a href=#>Stephanie McMahon</a>, she played the role of the Boss’s Wife and did a lot of the behind-the-scenes organization. She attracted talent such as Major Gunns and Shane Douglas. When this job didn’t satisfy her urges, she engaged in other forms of pleasure. Lizzy and her husband Rob Black were famous for acting and directing in adult&nbsp;films, particularly of the extreme variety. Lizzy was famous for making her actors drink vomit and other bodily fluids. Disgusting! So disgusting, in fact, they were thrown in prison in 2009 for the distribution of obscene materials. Lizzy moved on to produce her own music and to be the spokesmodel for Crash Music, Inc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-major-gunns><strong>14. Major Gunns</strong></h2><p>Tylene Buck, known as Major Gunns, was brought into wrestling along with many other fitness models hired to play the NWO girls. They were generally retained as eye candy for millions of (mostly male) viewers. She was positioned as a valet, then as an interviewer, and finally as a character who enjoyed stirring the proverbial pot – a verified troublemaker. After she was released by the company she joined Lizzy Borden’s Xtreme Pro Wrestling, which we discussed earlier in this article. This was probably her introduction to a more alternative style of career. At this point, she was just about ready to try anything. In December of 2005, she officially left wrestling for good and joined Seymore Butts’ Lighthouse Talent Agency. No joke. That’s actually the name of the man she works for. She still, to this day, does photo shoots and works as a cam girl.</p><h2 id=13-candice-michelle><strong>13. Candice Michelle</strong></h2><p>This former WWE Champion is probably one of the first that comes to mind when we think of wrestling stars who were involved in the “other” industry. She got her camera start doing softcore films like HBO’s Hotel Erotica and other films like the bondage favorite Hogtie Heaven. Surprisingly, she is still one of the most famous wrestling celebs to be connected to the adult film industry even though most of what she did was comparable to what you can see in an rated R movie. There was never anything too shocking or embarrassing – for the most part she was just bouncing around on some guy’s lap. I guess we couldn’t exactly call her behavior PG, but it certainly wasn’t as risque as the next person on our list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-chyna><strong>12. Chyna</strong></h2><p>The late Chyna is, arguably, the most famous WWE star who moved on to the dark side of the TV and film industry. Before her second career, she was an intense athlete that trained with extremely regimented coaches and took her career very seriously. Incredibly, she was the first woman to win the WWE’s Intercontinental Championship. Three times. Then, she moved on to more exotic things. She even transformed her body from an extremely masculine and fit build to a more angled and feminine frame. Known as the Ninth Wonder of the World, she graced the cover of one of the best-selling issues of Playboy of all time and was X-Pac’s counterpart in their famously scandalous film One Night in China. Her most famous role as an adult film star is as She-Hulk in film parodies.</p><h2 id=11-gangrel><strong>11. Gangrel</strong></h2><p>The WWE tried to make a comeback with Gangrel in the early 2000’s as part of a new vampire scheme. When he wasn’t able to lose enough weight, the idea was scratched. That’s when David Heath moved in a new career direction. It’s hard to imagine Gangrel, the infamous wrestler of the living dead, making an adult film. Those teeth! I guess the vampire craze really did begin long before Twilight. Well, Gangrel didn’t actually star in any risque movies but in 2007, Heath did sign on to New Porn Order to direct 12 different films. There’s a lot of room for vampire scenes in 12 different movies! His debut film was creatively titled Miami Rump Shakerz 2. I wonder what his two sons thought of this?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-mickie-james><strong>10. Mickie James</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Mickie James</a> is one of the best-known names in the wrestling biz. But when the going gets tough... Am I right? Sometimes we all have to compromise ourselves to pay the bills and James was no exception. Before Mickie was a five-time WWE Women’s Champion and a household name, she was paid cash money to pose fully nude in publications and websites like NaughtyMag.com. Now these weren’t sexy lingerie photos in Maxim, they were full-frontal, fully exploitive pictures of her sans any inch of fabric. She only quit her nude modeling gig when she started making enough money from wrestling full-time. We’d like to remember her solely for her physical strength, but it’s hard to bury this kind of hatchet. After she reached the pinnacle of wrestling success, she moved on to singing country music. What a multi-faceted woman!</p><h2 id=9-x-pac><strong>9. X-Pac</strong></h2><p>In 2004, X-Pac made an adult film with then-fiancee Chyna titled One Night in China. He probably thought they’d stay together forever, but they actually ended up calling it quits before the video was even released. Coincidently, the same company (titled Red Light District) put out the <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> tape One Night in Paris the same year. This video in particular contains many descriptions of different acts of love making and has sold over 100,000 copies. In 2006, it actually <a href=#>won an Adult Video News Award</a> for Top Selling Release of the Year. I guess it was pretty good stuff! Perhaps meant to excuse his actions, X-Pac admitted to being high while making the film. This was the only big release from X-Pac but his ex Chyna went on to make many other videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-hulk-hogan><strong>8. Hulk Hogan</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a>. An adult film star? Seems pretty hard to believe, or maybe even too good to believe. Hogan’s film, however, wasn’t exactly professional – it was a video recording of him getting busy with Heather Clem, his then-best friend Bubba the Love Sponge’s wife. Yikes! In 2012 it was released to the public through the website Gawker.com and Hogan sued in a fit of rage after realizing his personal activities had been shown through the public vein of the world wide web. Hogan claimed he was unaware that he was even being filmed and won the lawsuit for $140 million. Hulk said his whole world turned “totally upside down” when the tape was released and rumors have circulated that Bubba planned the whole event, right down to recording and releasing it himself. With friends like these, who needs enemies?</p><h2 id=7-buff-bagwell><strong>7. Buff Bagwell</strong></h2><p>Buff Bagwell, also known as the Handsome Stranger, was known for both his dashing good looks as well as engaging in tag-team competitions in the ring. He was the five-time tag-team champion before the WCW terminated&nbsp;his contract. In 2014, the press released a few articles claiming that Buff Bagwell had <a href=#>taken his talents from the ring to the bedroom</a>. Earlier that year, it was reported that he had already been working as a gigolo for the company Cowboys 4 Angels where he was charging $3000 for johns to spend the night with a beautiful lady. He is currently employed by adult entertainment moguls Vivid Entertainment. All with the full permission and support of his wife, of course. Do we think this is creepy? Yes. Yes we do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-tammy-sunny-sytch><strong>6. Tammy “Sunny” Sytch</strong></h2><p>20 years ago, Tammy Sytch was at the top of the world as one of the hottest women on television. She was inducted into the WWE’s Hall of Fame in 2011 and starred in numerous sexy photo spreads. She was known to charge fans money for naked Skype calls, but that’s not why she’s on this list. In January of 2016, Sunny signed with adult entertainment company Vivid Entertainment and released her first feature film. The 43 year old does pretty much every nasty little thing you could imagine in the video and was paid “much, much more” than the original $100k Vivid Entertainment offered her. The name? Sunny Side Up: In Through the Backdoor, which pretty much wins for adult film name of the year.</p><h2 id=5-bubba-ray-dudley><strong>5. Bubba Ray Dudley</strong></h2><p>Remember Lizzy Borden and her scandalous acts that got her and her husband Rob Black thrown in prison? Well Black was a good friend of Bubba Ray Dudley’s and it was through him that he got his big break not in acting, but in directing adult films. Surprisingly, this was one of Bubba’s childhood dreams, along with being a rock star and a pro wrestler. Two out of three isn’t so bad! Black wanted to get into wrestling the same way Bubba wanted to try something new, so they helped each other out. Black told Bubba he could work with whatever star in the industry he wanted to, and so he chose <a href=#>Ron Jeremy</a>. I guess the next step for Bubba Ray Dudley is rock superstardom!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-amy-weber><strong>4. Amy Weber</strong></h2><p>Amy Weber was brought in as a villainous Diva for WWE’s SmackDown in 2004. In 2005, she resigned due to alleged harassment from some of the other wrestlers. Amy starred in a few soft-core films both before and after her stint in the WWE. I guess she didn’t want to put that fantastic body to waste! After she tired of these kinds of gigs, Amy recorded with Dauman Music and released a single titled Let It Rain in 2012. It did fairly well, staying on the U.S. Billboard chart for more than a month and reaching #6 on the UK Singles Chart. After working as the face of Shiseido cosmetics, she finally settled on a career selling real estate in the greater LA area. Talk about a Jill of all Trades!</p><h2 id=3-beulah-mcgillicutty><strong>3. Beulah McGillicutty</strong></h2><p>Trisha Laughlin, aka Beulah McGillicutty, both fought and managed wrestlers in the ECW. However, she was probably most notable for accompanying Tommy Dreamer, her partner in crime both in and out of the ring. The couple was married and had twin girls in 2004, who started out acting on The Sopranos. In the meantime, Momma McGillicutty was making some videos of her own. Apparently originally intended for Dreamer’s eyes only, Beulah film herself masturbating and the video went viral. You’d think she would have been more careful! Shortly after this, Beulah wrote a children’s book in 2012 titled Gertrude the Great. Maybe this was an attempt to gain forgiveness for her naughty acts? Let’s assume she wants to be a remembered as a children’s novelist and not as a floozy who was victimized by social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-chastity><strong>2. Chastity</strong></h2><p>Oh, the irony! Denise “Chastity” Riffle perhaps chose the wrong ring name to represent her true personality. She is probably the least well-known wrestler on this list, as she entered the WWE for a short time and really only had one storyline, in which she had a disagreement with Beulah McGillicutty (who you might remember from earlier in the article, when she sent her husband a sexy video that went viral). Before joining the WWE Chastity worked as a stripper but after she left the company, she turned to adult films. She even had a part in the cleverly named Tiger’s Wood. When all is said and done, it’s easy to see how Denise Riffle is better remembered as an adult film star than as a WWE celebrity.</p><h2 id=1-ariel><strong>1. Ariel</strong></h2><p>Shelly Martinez, known in the WWE as “Ariel,” “Salinas,” or simply “Shelly,” started working in the WWE after she starred in an independent film based on wrestling. She began her professional wrestling career in 2005 alongside Beth Phoenix. Together, they had an erotic gimmick that implied a relationship between the two of them. Shelly left the WWE in 2008 but continued working in TV and film as an adult entertainment star. She posed nude a number of times and participated in an all-female bondage film titled The Notorious Jewel De’Nyle & Shelly Martinez. Perhaps a continuation of her Arial character in the WWE, Shelly is currently a leader in the horror fantasy and film community. She is the official Hollywood correspondent for the horror news website <a href=#>MoreHorror.com</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCfmLiqusZoaG5llqS%2FrrHRZq6wnV2owaK%2B0mauoaddmru1sdGem2asmJp6sMDHnqlmoZ6ZwrTA0bJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zoey-siewert-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Zoey Siewert Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
