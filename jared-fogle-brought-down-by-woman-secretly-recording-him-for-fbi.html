"He told me that he thought middle school girls were so hot," the reporter told the outlet. "I was in shock, I actually was questioning, 'Did I really just hear what I think I heard?' I looked over at my cameraman and he was just astounded," she said.</p><p>Herman says she saw Fogle many times over the years, and when she contacted authorities, they asked her to wear a wire to record her communication.</p><p>"He talked about sex with underage children," she alleged. "It was just something that he really, really enjoyed. He trusted me for unknown reasons," the reporter continued. "He had said to me numerous times over the course of years about having sex with minors."</p><p>In fact, the married pitchman got so comfortable with Herman, she claims that he even included her own children in their conversations.</p><p>"I had two young children at the time, and he talked to me about installing hidden cameras in their rooms and asked me if I would choose which child I would like him to watch," she said.</p><p>Obviously horrified by the talk, Herman says she remained focused on her role: gathering information for the FBI. "I had to play a certain part in order for Jared to be able to trust me and talk further into detail," she continued.</p><p>The U.S. Attorney's Office in Indianapolis, where Fogle was based, said Herman's information was part of the federal investigation into the former pitchman.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to prosecutors, Fogle is planning to plead guilty to child pornography charges. As <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> previously reported, the plea deal would see him serve between five and 12 and a half years in prison.</p><p>Fogle's wife, Katie Fogle, <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from her disgraced husband on Wednesday, Aug. 19, citing "an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage." Katie said in a statement that she was "shocked and disappointed" by the recent revelations. "My focus is exclusively on the well-being of my children (Brady, born in 2011, and Quinn, born in 2013)," she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaKasW6yzqCjnmWSp7y2s8etZJ2np6N6o8WMsKammZ5iwKav0Z6rpbFdp7Kku9GdoKefXZ22rnnFqKlmnpKeenN8kG5panBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-how-pete-davidson-earns-and-spends-his-8-million-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Here's How Pete Davidson Earns And Spends His $8 Million Net Worth</span></a>
