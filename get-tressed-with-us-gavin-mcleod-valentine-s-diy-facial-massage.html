Here at&nbsp;<i>Stylish</i>, we’ve never seen a hairstyle or makeup trend we couldn’t talk about for days on end, so we started a podcast to dish on all the latest beauty news — from hits and misses on the red carpet to celebrity hair and makeup gurus’ dos and don’ts.

Listen in awe as McLeod-Valentine spills his secrets for the exact technique he uses to give his clients firmer, more sculpted features.

His favorite antioxidant is Kakadu Plum — listen to the episode and find out why!</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The powerhouse ingredient can be found in <a href=#>Intraceuticals’ Booster Antioxidant</a> serum, the brand McLeod-Valentine works with. <a href=#>Intraceuticals is taking action</a> during the coronavirus crisis by donating $100,000 of complimentary skincare every month to healthcare professionals.
