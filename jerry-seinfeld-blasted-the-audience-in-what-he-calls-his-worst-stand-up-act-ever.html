Still in his early 20s at the time, Seinfeld was intrigued by the pay of the gig, which would land the comedian $100.</p><p>However, Jerry would quickly learn that the gig wasn't exactly what he was expecting. The comedian reveals, "Everyone in the room was dancing, and they didn't turn down the music. You feel like you're inside a human heart. The microphone didn't even go all the way around. Nobody even knew I was on."</p><p>Seinfeld then left the stage and asked the manager for his pay. The manager didn't even know Jerry performed, while the comedian told him that "nobody did."</p><p>Jerry would go on to reveal that it was the first and last time he would ever accept a gig in Queens and at a disco.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/christine-taylor-had-completely-different-experiences-with-jerry-seinfeld-and-david-schwimmer-on-their-respective-sitcoms.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Christine Taylor Had Completely Different Experiences With Jerry Seinfeld And David Schwimmer On Their Respective Sitcoms</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Christine Taylor had different experiences on Friends and Seinfeld, revealing she had to 'swallow her pride' alongside David Schwimmer.</span><p>Fans were split with regard to the story. Some felt as though Jerry bombing was his fault at all. While others believe that Jerry was protecting his ego by sharing the story.</p><p>One fan wrote, "That's not bombing, that's just technical difficulties. Bombing is when people actually hear your jokes and sit silently or boo you, or shout "get the hell off the stage!" lol."</p><p>Another fan wrote, "He bombed because nobody heard him. It's as if to say, "If anybody who heard what I was saying, I would not have bombed." This is the kind of "humility" that narcissists exhibit. He's supposed to tell us his lowest moment, but it's not actually a low moment in terms of his performance."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the fans were skeptical about his answer - it was Jerry's worst experience. At least, according to him.</p><h2 id=jerry-seinfeld-didn-39-t-care-if-he-39-d-be-successful-with-comedy-early-on>Jerry Seinfeld Didn't Care If He'd Be Successful With Comedy Early On</h2><p>Speaking alongside CNBC, Jerry revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he just knew he'd found his calling as a comedian</a>. This was especially apparent given that Jerry wasn't spending too much time thinking about the fame and fortune that could come out of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar49650042-1.jpg><p>He revealed, “I just inhaled this stuff. I just couldn’t get enough of it. “The truth is I really didn’t think that I could and I didn’t really care whether I could or I couldn’t. I just got to this point where I was so in love with it that I just decided, ‘What’s the difference? What’s the difference?’ It seemed much more important to do the thing you want to do than success or failure,” says Seinfeld.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jerry-seinfeld-completely-silenced-a-paparazzi-after-he-was-told-he-never-had-to-work-again.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld Completely Silenced A Paparazzi With The Perfect Response After He Was Told He Never Had To Work Again</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jerry Seinfeld was not in the mood to talk on this given day, and the interviewer learned all about that rather quickly.</span><p>“This is my thing,” he says. “I know how to do this.

In fact, the comedian still recalls the first ever joke he told.</p><h2 id=jerry-seinfeld-still-recalls-the-first-joke-he-ever-told>Jerry Seinfeld Still Recalls The First Joke He Ever Told</h2><p>What was Jerry's first joke he ever told? It was about being left-handed. The comedian took to Instagram, recalling his first joke ever, one that was written on a scrap piece of paper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar49494576-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“So, I am left handed. Left-handed people do not like that the word left is so often associated with negative things. Left feet. Left-handed compliment. ‘What are we having for dinner? Leftovers.’ You go to a party there is nobody there. ‘Where did everybody go?’ ‘They left!’” “That was it, that was my first joke,” Seinfeld says.</p><p>He continues, “It just occurred to me that all these left words are negative. Left-handed compliment. You know, you hear that and then I thought, ‘Well that is weird. Why are they putting that on us?’ And, ‘they left’ — and so that was the joke.”</p><p>That was just the start to a fantastic career and one Jerry himself could not have predicted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqqirnq0scinnZ6klGKvra3SrZydZaSdsm6t1J2gnqaTmnqquoywn5qsXZ2ybq%2FApaOsZZiewG7DzquqrWWjqa6vsIyup2aZk6l6psLEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eva-mendes-ryan-gosling-are-teaching-their-daughters-spanish.html><span>←</span><span>Eva Mendes, Ryan Gosling Are Teaching Their Daughters Spanish</span></a>
