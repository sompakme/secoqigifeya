Because I'd be like, 'I don't want the robe. I'm hot. I'm eating.' Everybody's like, 'She needs to cover up'." Jennifer previously told media outlets that she felt extremely anxious when filming intimate scenes, but she acknowledges that her attitude toward that aspect of her career has changed. "I don't have the same fear and insecurity in that one specific area that I used to. So you know, I'm always gonna take on roles for the same reason. The character speaks to me and the director and the story. But I'm no longer gonna let that be a factor in my decision making."</p><p><strong>PREVIOUSLY: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HOW JENNIFER LAWRENCE BECAME HOLLYWOOD'S IT GIRL</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 27-year-old actress is currently one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, having been a part of some of the most successful movies of the past few years.&nbsp; However, her last film, psychological thriller&nbsp;Mother!&nbsp;divided critics and audiences alike, causing it to bomb at the Box Office.
