jimmy stewart follows kim to where your portrait hangs on a wall
such a haunting vision he forgets his partner’s fall
jump into the san francisco bay

i know you can’t swim
when you’ve been dead 100 years, carlotta
Carlotta Valdez, i will make you her.
everything’s subjective, nothing lasts for johnny o.
kiss kim novak where the redwoods grow
i’ll bleach her hair and pretend she didn’t die</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Much Money Does Jimmy Webb Make? Latest Jimmy Webb Net Worth Income Salary</h2><time>Sep 21, 2024</time>
