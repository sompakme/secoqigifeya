<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Best WWE Crown Jewel Matches</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#>WWE Crown Jewel</a> has solidified itself as one of the major premium live events over the past few years. The big attraction in Saudi Arabia boasts who’s who of WWE, such as Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, and Brock Lesnar.</p><p>Speaking of Roman Reigns, the Tribal Chief will be in action in the main event of WWE Crown Jewel 2023 against LA Knight. There’s no denying that Reigns has been part of some incredible matches over the course of the PLE’s six-year existence.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s take a look at some of the best WWE Crown Jewel matches:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Cesaro vs. Mansoor (WWE Crown Jewel 2019)</h2><p>This is a great match that can be regarded as a hidden gem in Crown Jewel’s young history. This match followed the turbulent tag team turmoil match. Fans were firmly behind their hometown hero in Mansoor, who was against the big and strong Cesaro.</p><p>Both men worked incredibly hard to put on one of the best WWE Crown Jewel matches to date. Mansoor found strength in crowd support and absolutely thrived as he put away the Swiss Superman for a massive win.</p><p>Both men have since parted ways with WWE.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Big E vs. Drew McIntyre (WWE Championship Match – Crown Jewel 2021)</h2><p>Big E shocked the world with a cash-in win over Bobby Lashley for the WWE Championship. The New Day member put his title on the line against former champion Drew McIntyre in the third-last match of Crown Jewel 2021.</p><p>McIntyre proved once again why he was one of the most consistent and reliable workers in WWE at the time. Big E showed unwavering determination in the face of the Scottish Warrior to retain his title in this solid match.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Becky Lynch vs. Bianca Belair vs. Sasha Banks (Triple Threat Match for SmackDown Women’s Championship – Crown Jewel 2021)</h2><p>After giving fans a spectacular WrestleMania 37 main event, Bianca Belair and Sasha Banks ran it back at Crown Jewel in October. This time, however, the pair were joined by Becky Lynch to determine the fate of the SmackDown Women’s Championship.</p><p>This triple threat match emerged as one of the best matches in WWE Crown Jewel history. All three women made the most out of the 20-minute allotted time. Lynch worked the crowd with her incredible heel work.</p><p>In the end, The Man retained her title with a ropes-aided roll-up pin – much to the disdain of the crowd in attendance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2022/11/roman-reigns-logan-paul-wwe-crown-jewel.jpg><h2>Logan Paul vs. Roman Reigns (WWE Undisputed Universal Championship Match – Crown Jewel 2022)</h2><p>Logan Paul had arguably one of the greatest rookie years in modern WWE. The Maverick partook in some high-profile matches, but the best of them all came against Roman Reigns at WWE Crown Jewel 2022.</p><p>The duo battled for over 25 minutes to determine the fate of the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. Paul even injured himself after he landed a picture-perfect splash on the champion all the way through the announcer’s desk.</p><p>However, the social media megastar fought through pain to deliver a match of the year contender. Reigns, on the other hand, showcased immaculate in-ring psychology, as he emerged victorious in one of the best WWE Crown Jewel matches thus far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2021/11/edge-seth-rollins-jessika-carr-wwe-11.jpg><h2 id=h-edge-vs-seth-rollins-hell-in-a-cell-match-wwe-crown-jewel-2021>Edge vs. Seth Rollins (Hell in a Cell Match – WWE Crown Jewel 2021)</h2><p>Edge versus Seth Rollins is one of those rare feuds that looked good both on paper and inside the ring. The pair had an incredible trilogy of matches in 2021, but the best bout came at WWE Crown Jewel on October 21.</p><p>The two superstars found themselves within the confines of the infamous Hell in a Cell. The action itself turned out to be extremely grueling and intense. The work rate went off the charts as the superstars became creative and comfortable with the brutal surroundings.</p><p>The shocking conclusion saw the Rated R Superstar stomp the Monday Night Messiah face-first through a steel chair for the win.</p><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2><ul><li>Team Hogan vs. Team Flair (WWE Crown Jewel 2019)</li><li>Mansoor vs. Mustafa Ali (Crown Jewel 2021)</li><li>Bianca Belair vs. Bayley (Crown Jewel 2022)</li></ul><p>WWE Crown Jewel 2023 takes place at the Mohamed Abdo Theater in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, November 4.
