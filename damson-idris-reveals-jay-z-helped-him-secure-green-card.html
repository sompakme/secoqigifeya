I had to ask him. But he’s done many things for me over the years. He’s always supported me. He supports everyone. He supports so many people that you don’t even know. Like, genuinely I should tell everyone this right now. If you ever run into Jay-Z, just say thank you and keep it moving because he is definitely a pioneer of the culture, but of everything. And I’ve never told him this, but he’s a huge idol of mine. Thank you for that reference.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=#>Swarm star</a> continued to explain, “I won’t tell you how it happened, because there are a couple more favors I might need in the future. But yeah, he hooked me up with that. Rich Paul did too. Tommy Schlamme. Eric Schrier. Sorry, Schyrer. A bunch of people hooked me up. You know, they’re people who just believe in me. Believe in this journey that I’m on and, and yeah, I’m gonna repay a favor to the people who come behind me too.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This is not the first time recently that the actor has spoken about his relationship with “Mr. Carter” and the entire family.

It’s amazing to have giants like that who have your back.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5murr%2FOp2SinKKewG62wLJks2WjmrC2vsRmnqudlaN6pK3RnWRqamNphHWBj3FqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bob-orton-speaks-on-heat-with-taker-challenges-john-cena-sr.html><span>←</span><span>Bob Orton Speaks on Heat With Taker, Challenges John Cena Sr.</span></a>
