She began as a television actress, appearing in shows like Good Times, Diff'rent Strokes, and Fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her music career started with two uninspired albums she later admitted her father forced her to do. That all changed when she released "Control" in 1986.</p><p>The album saw Jackson writing her own songs and forging a path away from the shadow of her famous family.</p><p>For the next 17 years, Jackson would release one hit album after another and go on huge world tours. She even starred in films like 1993's Poetic Justice with Tupac Shakur. Jackson influenced many singers who came after her like Britney Spears and Ciara. However, fans feel like Jackson isn't remembered or discussed as much as her contemporaries like Madonna and Mariah Carey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of her fans blame the fallout from the Super Bowl halftime show on why Jackson's legacy is rarely mentioned. However, this might be too simplified of a reason.</p><h2 id=the-super-bowl-incident-put-janet-jackson-in-the-headlines-for-the-wrong-reasons>The Super Bowl Incident Put Janet Jackson In The Headlines For The Wrong Reasons</h2><p>When Jackson performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004, Justin Timberlake ripped off a piece of her costume. Jackson reacted with shock and later said that while Timberlake was supposed to tear off the piece, she wasn't supposed to be exposed. <a href=#>Timberlake released his own statement</a>, using the now infamous term "wardrobe malfunction."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to this incident, <a href=#>Jackson was allegedly blacklisted</a> by Viacom, CBS, MTV, and Infinity Broadcasting. At the time, Jackson was about to release her "Damita Jo" album, and none of its videos were played on MTV. At the time, MTV denied a blacklist was taking place, saying that Jackson's videos weren't played because they simply didn't receive any demand. This continued during her "20 Y.O." album promotional tour in 2006.</p><p>While the alleged blacklist likely effected sales of both albums, it was over by the time Jackson's "Discipline" album was released in 2008. Jackson promoted the album on the MTV show TRL and performed her single "Feedback." The network even made Jackson their Artist of the Month and Jackson did commercials where she parodied their reality shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jackson was promoting her upcoming release everywhere from Good Morning America to Larry King Live. Buzz was high for the album and the single "Feedback" was a huge hit. When "Discipline" was finally released, <a href=#>it reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart</a>, her first since 2001's "All For You."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Janet Jackson Reveals What Changed Her Relationship With Michael Jackson In Documentary</a></span></p><h2 id=janet-jackson-s-music-went-into-a-different-direction>Janet Jackson's Music Went Into A Different Direction</h2><p>The initial buzz the album received soon died down for a number of reasons. For starters, Jackson had some disagreements with her new label, Island Def Jam, over the album's direction.</p><p>For the next single, Jackson wanted to release the house-influenced song "Rock With U," whereas her label wanted to release "Luv." Apparently, this creative disagreement led to all further promotion of the album to be halted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, there was another reason the "Discipline" album fizzled out. Like with Jackson's previous album, "20 Y.O.," the album was produced by Jackson's then-boyfriend Jermaine Dupri. Dupri and Jackson may have had great personal chemistry, but the public's impression was that their chemistry didn't extend to the recording studio. When critics reviewed "20 Y.O.," many felt it was overproduced and cited Dupri's involvement as an example.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Janet Jackson's Marriage End Because Of Her Brother?</a></span></p><h2 id=janet-jackson-s-future-projects-and-latest-work>Janet Jackson's Future Projects And Latest Work</h2><p>As a result of the lack of success the "Discipline" album received, <a href=#>Jackson asked to be let out of her contract</a> with Island Def Jam. Over the next three years, Jackson released a greatest hits album, self-help book, two films, and embarked on a world tour.</p><p>She then got married and quietly disappeared for several years. Jackson was hardly ever photographed by paparazzi, rarely posted on social media, and never gave an interview.</p><p>Then, in 2015, Jackson released her "Unbreakable" album and went on another tour. The tour wouldn't be rescheduled until 2017, being renamed the "State of the World Tour." Jackson didn't release any new music until 2018, when she collaborated with Daddy Yankee on "Made For Now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Janet Jackson And Jermaine Dupri?</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Jackson did announce an album</a>, "Black Diamond," before the pandemic. However, even though she premiered a documentary series about her life and performed at music festivals this year, no release date has been announced.</p><p>It reamins to be seen what the future holds for Janet Jackson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifsKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGLBsHnJmqWerF2frqS30qilrGWTlr%2BmsdFmmJ%2Bslad6tbTEZqquqJWneqO71qVm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephanie-george-donnell-rawlings-wife-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family.html><span>←</span><span>Stephanie George (Donnell Rawlings Wife) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family</span></a>
