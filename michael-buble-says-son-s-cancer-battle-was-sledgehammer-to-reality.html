“My son’s cancer diagnosis rocked my world,” Bublé , 48, shared on “The Diary of a CEO” podcast episode on Thursday, December 21. “It pulled a curtain from over my eyes.”
Bublé called his now 10-year-old’s battle “a sledgehammer” to his “reality,” and said he “will never be carefree again” in his life “and that’s OK.” (Bublé shares Noah, as well as Elias, 7, Vida, 5, and Cielo, 16 months, with wife Luisana Lopilato."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

My family was always a love … I don’t think I was a terrible guy but it was blinders — career, ambition, how do I become the baddest, biggest, best? More ego, more power, more money.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Michael-Buble-Says-Son-Cancer-Battle-Was-a-Sledgehammer-2.jpg><p>While Bublé felt like he was living with a “curtain” in front of him, it disappeared “in a moment” when “reality hit.”</p><p>“I went, ‘OK, this is it, this is life, this is what’s important,’” he said. “It’s not like I thought about it, I didn’t, there was no time to process it.”</p><p>He continued: “I remember closing my eyes and saying to myself, if we get out of this I’m living a different life, a better life. And I did, I made that promise to myself in a moment.”</p><p>Bublé took a career hiatus after Noah’s diagnosis in 2016. While his son is in remission, he told Australia’s Today show that <a href=#>“it sucks and it still sucks.”</a></p><p>“What we went through is the worst possible thing you can go through as a parent and maybe as a human being,” he said in October 2018, adding that there were days in which he and wife Lopilato, 36, “were just surviving, struggling to survive, and to breathe.”</p><p>He continued: “I much rather would have it have been me. Many times I wish that it had been.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While his son is in remission, the “Haven’t Met You Yet” singer shared that the physical and mental effects have <a href=#>taken a toll</a> on him.</p><p>“I’m not OK,” he said in October 2018 during a segment of <strong>James Corden</strong>’s Carpool Karaoke. “My wife honestly, when this all started, I became the strength to somehow pull us and lift us and to be positive … and when they got it out, and the chemo was done and they said, ‘We did it, it’s good, he’s OK,’ I just fell.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamoZOdrqa4jJusm6SVYsCixdJmqqimo2KworrCnqlmmpGpwa2xjLCYrGWjobKls8ShmKallad6tbuMq5yapJmpxnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./list-of-3-letter-words-starting-with-ew.html><span>←</span><span>List of 3 Letter Words Starting With 'ew'</span></a>
