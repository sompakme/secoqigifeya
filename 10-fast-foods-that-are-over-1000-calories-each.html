It's fat, greasy and completely unhealthy, yet we still fill up drive-thrus and keep take out's busy, because, let's face it, it's always the bad stuff that tastes so good. Of course, everything in moderation. But do you know just how bad some of the fast food out there really is? The normal calorie intake for a sedentary person is around 1800 to 2500 a day, of course dependent on age, gender, activity level and overall health. But that's for three complete meals, drinks and snacks in a 24-hour period. Imagine consuming nearly one half to a third of your daily calorie intake on just one, single fast food item. It happens more than you'd like to think. We break down 10 fast food items, some of which might be your go-to, all time favorite, that break the calorie bank at over a whopping 1000 calories, each. You might think twice next time you're in the mood for some take-out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=subway-s-12-spicy-tuna-sandwich>10. Subway's 12" Spicy Tuna Sandwich</h2><p>via: subway.com</p><p>Sorry tuna lovers, Subway's 12" take on tuna, their 'Spicy Tuna' sandwich, isn't doing you any good. At a whopping 1040 calories, we wonder how Jared really ever lost all that weight. So an all-Subway diet? No thanks. Especially because their bread is made with a chemical, azodicarbonamide, which is also used in the production of yoga mats, though their fazing it's use in their production. For anyone who thinks they're doing themselves a favor by stopping at Subway over McDonalds, hate to break it to you, but you're not.</p><p></p><h2 id=cinnabon-caramel-pecanbon>9. Cinnabon Caramel Pecanbon</h2><p>Via: http://cinnabonhonduras.com/</p><p>Doesn't that look&nbsp;delicious? Dessert is many people's weak link –we just can't resist a taste of something sweet. And Cinnabon's Caramel Pacanbon would surely hit the spot when a craving kicks in. But at 1080 calories, it's probably more fattening than all of your meals for the day combined, with 50 grams of fat, 960 mg of sodium and 76 grams of sugar. Ouch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=boston-pizza-fried-wings>8. Boston Pizza Fried Wings</h2><p>via: triedtestedandtruemommy.wordpress.com</p><p>A double-sized serving of these Boston Pizza fried chicken wings will set you back 1080 calories. Order these as an entree and you've basically got no calorie-room left for your main meal (or the best part, dessert). So while they look oh-so-delicious, they're deviously bad for you.</p><p></p><h2 id=large-mcdonalds-triple-thick-shake>7. Large McDonalds Triple Thick Shake</h2><p>via: www.taiyangbao.ca</p><p>Nothing beats the summer heat quite like a thick, creamy chocolate shake. And McDonald's has a pretty good one, too. But for a large in any of the three flavors it's available in, you'd be consuming 1160 calories, 28 grams of fat and 690 mg of sodium. So we think we'll just be diving into the pool this summer, rather than grabbing a shake to cool down.</p><p></p><h2 id=burger-king-triple-whopper-with-cheese>6. Burger King Triple Whopper with Cheese</h2><p>via: www.thesavory.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Burger King's Triple Whopper Burger with Cheese might look delicious, but it's not doing such good things to your body at 1160 calories, for the burger<strong>&nbsp;alone</strong>. Tack on fries and a soda, and, well, it's not looking too good, at around 1860 calories for the entire meal. You'll also enjoy the 75 grams of fat and 1050 mg of sodium packed into just the burger. That's nearly a whole day's worth of food in one sitting. Enjoy!</p><p></p><h2 id=taco-bell-xxl-steak-nachos>5. Taco Bell XXL Steak Nachos</h2><p>Via: http://www.tacobell.com</p><p>Mmmm, nachos. Who doesn't love some crispy chips, cheese, dipping sauce and steak, as Taco Bell has so lovingly prepared? Well, their XXL Steak Nacho's won't come without the calories. These babies, as yummy as they may be, ring in at 1190 calories. We'd say sharing is caring with this dish –the more you share, the more you'll be cutting down on your portion of the 60 grams of fat and 2210 mg of sodium found in this plate. Damn.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2 id=five-guys-burgers-and-fries-large-fry>4. Five Guys Burgers and Fries Large Fry</h2><p>Via: www.blogto.com</p><p>We all enjoy that mouth watering burger, but we can also all agree that nothing completes a meal quite like some yummy, crispy french fries. But the guys over at Five Guys Burgers and Fries have amped up their large fry to be a crazy 1314 calories. We seriously hope you're sharing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=dairy-queen-large-chocolate-chip-cookie-dough-blizzard>3. Dairy Queen Large Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Blizzard</h2><p>Via: http://www.dairyqueen.com/</p><p>Dairy Queen's chocolate chip cookie dough Blizzard is easily one of the best things on earth. It's thick ice cream (served upside-down to demonstrate)&nbsp;combined with cookie dough, so really, does it get any better than that? But amidst all that deliciousness is a&nbsp;ton of calories that make you wonder if ordering a large was really worth it (it probably was, plus the medium's still over 1000 calories, anyway). Find 1340 calories hidden in the icy treat, enough to make you feel pretty shameful for having dessert. Oh, and let's not forget about the 141 grams of sugar, too. Yum!</p><p></p><h2 id=quizno-s-large-italian-meatball-sub>2. Quizno's Large Italian Meatball Sub</h2><p>Via: http://www.edwardpond.com/</p><p>Subs: they're not that good for you. Especially this giant Italian meatball one, ready to order at any Quizno's. It might look mighty tasty, and we're sure it is, but all that flavor comes at a hit. Enjoy the large, which has 1530 calories, or if you're trimming down, the regular only has 1110. Maybe you can buy one in the morning and split the sandwich between all your meals?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=heart-attack-grill-s-quadruple-bypass-burger>1. Heart Attack Grill's Quadruple Bypass Burger</h2><p>This burger is the real deal and it's served at Las Vegas' Heart Attack Grill, where the more calories, the better. Their motto is to serve food worth dying for, literally, and waitresses are all donned in nurse's outfits while patients... um, diners, rather, have to sport hospital gowns. Over 350 pounds? You eat here for free –if you can walk out alive, that is. The quadruple bypass burger is said to be anywhere from six to 9000 calories, as it's home to three thick burger patties, 15 slices of bacon, special sauce, cheese and veggies, as if they even matter. Finish without having a heart attack (or throwing up) and we'll applaud you. But you better not eat for three days after, since you just consumed a couple of days worth of calories with one burger alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmpoXZuutMCMn6aonKNiwamt02aYq51dpMOmvoxqZ2loXZiurbvRopysZZWWsKl7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-marcus-lamb-s-wife-joni-lamb-wiki-age-bio-children-net-worth-family-joni-table-talk.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Marcus Lambs Wife?
