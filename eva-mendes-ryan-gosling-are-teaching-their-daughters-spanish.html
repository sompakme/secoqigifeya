So it’s adorable but it’s technically not a language. It’s Spanglish.”</p><p>The Ghost Rider star further explained that the couple’s daughters Esmeralda, 4, and Amada, 3, will say select words in Spanish, but cannot form a complete sentence in another language.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-teaching-kids-spanish-03.jpg><p>“So our little girl will be like, ‘Mommy, my boca (mouth) hurts because I think something got stuck in my diente (tooth),’” Mendes said. “It’s so cute, but that is not really gonna go great out there.”</p><p>Mendes and Gosling, who started dating in 2011, are<a href=#> notoriously private about their relationship</a>, but on The Talk, the clothing designer didn’t hold back about the La La Land star.</p><p>“I was never one of those women who really wanted children, and then I fell in love with Ryan,” Mendes gushed. “I was like, ‘Oh, I get it. I don’t want children, I want your children. I want your babies.”</p><p>This is not the first time in recent months that <a href=#>Mendes has credited her 38-year-old partner for her decision to have kids.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-teaching-kids-spanish-02.jpg><p>“[Kids were] the furthest thing from my mind,” she told Women’s Health in an interview published on April 16. “[Then] Ryan Gosling happened. I mean, falling in love with him. Then it made sense for me to have … not kids, but his kids. It was very specific to him.”</p><p>The Hitch actress added that motherhood is “such a learning experience.”</p><p>“They challenge you in so many ways. Like, I’m their mom. I have to rise up, and hopefully, most of the time I do, but sometimes it’s definitely maddening,” Mendes explained. “I don’t let them see me put attention to how I dress. They’ve never seen me get ready for something; they’ve never seen me at work. … I’m just Mom. And I’m more than happy to just be Mom.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaerpFiuqa6w56qZqqplrtus86so6Kml2Kus7GMrZyam5ieu6h506Gcoqpdma62s8etnKurXai9orrIrJ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-best-powder-laundry-detergents.html><span>←</span><span>10 Best Powder Laundry Detergents</span></a>
