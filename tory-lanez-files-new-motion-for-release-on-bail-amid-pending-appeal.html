The first motion <a href=#>was&nbsp;denied</a> by the judge&nbsp;last month. Today (Oct. 10), the new update was announced by Legal Affairs & Trials reporter Meghan Cuniff.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Tory Lanez has been in prison for three weeks, but he hasn’t given up on bail,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>she tweeted</a>. “His lawyers are asking an appellate court to let him out of prison as he appeals his convictions and 10-year sentence for shooting <a href=# id=auto-tag_megan-thee-stallion data-tag=megan-thee-stallion>Megan Thee Stallion</a>.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She added, “The arguments are nearly identical to the motion Judge Herriford rejected at the Sept. 14 hearing in LA (the one where Lanez called me a googly eyed bitch), including the forgoing of any mention of the rehab pushed at sentencing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here's the full request. The arguments are nearly identical to the motion Judge Herriford rejected at the Sept. 14 hearing in LA (the one where Lanez called me a googly eyed bitch), including the forgoing of any mention of the rehab pushed at sentencing. <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/2ekzZoh4sf</a>.</p>— Meghann Cuniff (@meghanncuniff) <a href=# rel=nofollow>October 10, 2023</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to the legal documents, the new motion urges the judge to consider that “the Canadian rapper <a href=# data-type=post data-id=682811>isn’t a flight risk</a> due to his high profile” and personal ties to the United States. It also raises “substantial legal questions” which his team believes could lead to a “reversal” — or “a reduced sentence” — if the motion is granted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“For the reasons presented, it is respectfully requested that this court exercise its discretion to permit Appellant Peterson’s release from custody on reasonable bail pending finality of his appeal,” attorney Crystal Morgan stated. “If granted, bail will allow him to continue his employment while staying in the geographic Los Angeles area, so that he may continue to support and lead his family, and be present during these formidable years with his young son.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She continued, “Based upon this Motion, and the previously mitigating factors, which were presented at his sentencing hearing, Appellant Peterson’s request for bail pending appeal is warranted.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1678141065.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Last month, Lanez <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234794213>provided an official message</a> from prison to his followers. The&nbsp;Toronto artist&nbsp;posted an audio clip to his Instagram of him delivering an update about his whereabouts, mental state, and new music on the way.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Ayo Umbrellas, what’s good? I’m talking to you from prison,” he began. “Man, I’m just happy to get out that bullsh*t county jail. They was hating on a young fly ni**a, you heard? Had me in 24-hour lockdown, half-sized cell by myself, no windows, no mirrors. Ni**a ain’t even seen himself in a whole year yo.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He then assured his followers that he is still in good spirits despite the troubling circumstances.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“But with all them disadvantages against me, my head has always been held high, man. I want y’all to know I’m in great spirits,” he continued. “My drive and my ambition is growing stronger and stronger every day. I’m so proud of how y’all been moving in my support, man. I know this feels like a scary time, but don’t be afraid, man. This sh*t don’t spark no fear in my heart at all.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8s8WMpZinnapiv6a4xJqqnmWfo3qjrcilZKmdnpm2r7OMmqepnZGherSxza2cp5uZo7RufZFsa3FoYG2FeXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-jessica-parker-s-most-honest-comments-on-aging.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Jessica Parkers Most Honest Comments on Aging</span></a>
