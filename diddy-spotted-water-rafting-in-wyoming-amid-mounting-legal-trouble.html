The outlet reported that on Friday (June 28), the Miami Beach commission voted to revoke and abolish “Sean Diddy Combs Day” in the 305.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The commission cited 2016 surveillance footage showing the businessman abusing and beating <a href=# id=auto-tag_cassie data-tag=cassie>Cassie</a> on camera at a hotel. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Miami Herald </a>reported that the final decision to overrule his commemorative day arrived on Wednesday (June 26) with no debate. According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>, Combs initially received the honor in October 2016, months after the events on the surveillance video took place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The footage also garnered a response from Diddy, who apologized to his ex-girlfriend, Cassie. Combs claimed to be disgusted by his “inexcusable” behavior and said he sought therapy for it. The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">apology felt empty to some fans</a> because Puffy has consistently declared that he was innocent of any allegations against him since November 2023.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In fact,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>he released his first statement</a><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>&nbsp;</a></strong>a month after Cassie’s November bombshell lawsuit, typing in all caps, “ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, I HAVE SAT SILENTLY AND WATCHED PEOPLE TRY TO ASSASSINATE MY CHARACTER [AND] DESTROY MY REPUTATION AND MY LEGACY. SICKENING ACCUSATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST ME BY INDIVIDUALS LOOKING FOR A QUICK PAYDAY.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, in a change of heart, he suddenly deleted his apology and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all the rest of his posts from Instagram</a> in June.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch the videos of Diddy’s whitewater rafting above.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-955790980.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m2pbDYZq6arJWnerOtxa2gp59drMawucinnmaklZyurXnTq6aumpyaenJ%2Bkm1vcmlhZn5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cameron-monaghan-s-role-in-star-wars-jedi-survivor-has-completely-changed-his-career-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Cameron Monaghan's Role In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Has Completely Changed His Career And Net Worth</span></a>
