Allegations from plaintiffs suggested that Drake's presence on stage alongside Scott contributed to the chaotic atmosphere that led to the unfortunate incident. Both rappers were criticized for not stopping their sets sooner when the crowd became overwhelmed and dangerous (though they’ve claimed to not have been aware at the time what was happening).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, Drake specifically defended himself by arguing that his appearance was merely as a guest and that he bore no responsibility for the event's planning or its tragic consequences. He emphasized that he played no role in inciting the crowd and, therefore, should not be held liable for any injuries or fatalities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/drake-2.jpg> Drake on the red carpet<p>Multiple lawsuits were filed in response to the 2021 incident, though a later report claimed that together they were <a href=#>worth upwards of $10 billion in damages</a>.
