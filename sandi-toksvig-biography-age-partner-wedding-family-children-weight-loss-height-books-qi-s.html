The two entered into the civil partnership in 2007 and have been together ever since. The lovebirds renewed their partnership on 29th March 2014 to commemorate legalization of same sex marriage in England and Wales. On 10th December 2014, the couple changed their civil partnership into married life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sandi-toksvig-wedding></span><span><strong>Sandi Toksvig Wedding</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sandi and her lover Debbie renewed their wedding vows on 29th March 2014 at the Southbank Centre in London. This is after being in a civil partnership since 2007.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sandi-toksvig-family></span><span><strong>Sandi Toksvig Family</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sandi’s parents are Claus Toksvig and Julie Anne Brett Toksvig. Her father was a Danish broadcaster, journalist and politician. He died on 5th November 1988. She has two sibling; Nick Toksvig, a bureau chief and senior news editor for Al Jazeera English and Jenifer Toksvig, an author, lyrist and playwright.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sandi-toksvig-children></span><span><strong>Sandi Toksvig Children</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sandi shares three children with her ex-wife Peta Stewart. They welcomed their first daughter, Jessica Toksving Stewart in 1988. In 1990, a second daughter was born and she was named Megan. Later in 1994, a son, Theo&nbsp; was born. Theo started acting acting at 20-something and and has since appeared in the 2018 short film Destroyer of Worlds.</p><p>In an interview with The Guardian, Jessica opened up about how they were conceived. She told them that the couple’s closest friends, a straight couple, agreed that the male, Chris Lloyd-Pack, would donate sperm. All 3 of them were conceived from the same donor sperm. Chris played an uncle-type role in their lives, Jesse said. She also revealed that Peta was her biological mother.</p><p>Jesse now lives with her boyfriend and has published her own inclusive baby book for new parents of all kinds. Not much is known about Megan, who seems to have stayed away from the spotlight quite a bit.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sandi-toksvig-weight-loss></span><span><strong>Sandi Toksvig Weight Loss</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Bake Off presenter has lost an impressive amount of weight in recent years, having reduced from a size 22 to a size 10. Sandi lost four stone by making one change to her diet plan, embarking on the plan when her partner became worried for her health.</p><p>She revealed that she has been following the Louise Parker diet plan. A plan which encourages followers to go sugar-free, exercise everyday and cut our complex carbs.<br>In her column, she also revealed: ‘When I first started I couldn’t touch my knees. Now I can run 5k no problem.”</p><p>Sandi’s image</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sandi-toksvig-height></span><span><strong>Sandi Toksvig Height</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Great British Bake off show kicked off with Noel Fielding, Sandi’s fellow host making fun of her height. This left many wondering how short she really is. The Bake Off presenter looks tiny compared to her co-presenters which is no surprise considering she is just 5ft tall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sandi-toksvig-books></span><span>Sandi Toksvig Books</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sandi is a profound writer. She has written more than 20 books, fiction and non-fiction for both adults and children. Here are some of the books she has written.</p><li>Hitler’s canary</li><li>Peas and queues</li><li>Whistling For The Elephants</li><li>Valentine Grey</li><li>Flying under Bridges</li><li>Girls Are best</li><li>The Chain of Curiosity</li><li>Melted into Air</li><li>Gladys Reunited</li><li>A slice of the moon</li><li>Heroines and Harridans</li><li>The Travels of lady Bulldog Burton</li><li>The littlest viking</li><li>The Troublesome Tooth Fairy</li><li>The End of the Sky</li><li>Unusual Day</li><li>Super-Saver Mouse</li><li>Silver lining</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sandi-toksvig-qi></span><span>Sandi Toksvig QI</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2016, Sandi took over BBC’s QI show as a host. While presenting an economics session at the Women’s Equality party conference on Saturday, the 60-year-old was questioned about her pay. She revealed that she is paid 40 per cent of what Fry, who previously hosted QI was paid. She said, “I get 40 per cent of what Stephen used to get and I get the same pay as Alan Davies who is one of the hosts. I temper this with the fact I love this show and am the first woman to host such a show.”</p><p>Before taking over QI, Toksvig was a well-known name. She had already hosted various quiz shows including Radio 4’s The News Quiz and Channel 4’s 1001 Things You Should Know. She also appeared on the very first episode of Have I Got News for You in 1990.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sandi-toksvig-speaking-danish></span><span><strong>Sandi Toksvig Speaking Danish</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sandi had always kept a low Danish profile until 2014, when she gave an interview to a Danish journalist. She explained that she had not done it before because she didn’t want the spotlight to be on her family in Denmark.<br>Sandi speaks the finest Danish with cautious hesitation and a gentle accent as weekendavisen describes it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sandi-toksving-interview></span><span>Sandi Toksving interview</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sandi was interviewed by Rosanna Greenstreet and here she gives all those small details of her life.</p><p>When were you happiest?<br>Last Tuesday at 10 past three.</p><p>What is your greatest fear?<br>Being stuck in a lift with a man who is confident he can fix it.</p><p>What is your earliest memory?<br>My parents forgetting my fourth birthday, and feeling my first sense of injustice.</p><p>What is the trait you most deplore in yourself?<br>My inability to eat without spilling.</p><p>What is the trait you most deplore in others?<br>Unkindness and tax avoidance.</p><p>What was your most embarrassing moment?<br>Telling a woman in the street who thought we were at school together that she probably recognised me from the telly, only to find that we were actually at school together.</p><p>Property aside, what’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought?<br>My five-litre Ford Mustang.</p><p>What is your most treasured possession?<br>My five-litre Ford Mustang.</p><p>What is your wallpaper?<br>My five-litre Ford Mustang.</p><p>What do you most dislike about your appearance?<br>I have no idea.
