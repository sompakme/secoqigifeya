The man worth a whopping&nbsp;$169.8 billion is now living in a 400 square feet home. Musk rents his new, rectangular, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mini bachelor pad</a> for more than modest $50,000 a month. This is pretty shocking to many seeing as how the combined amount the assets he's sold is nearly $70 million.</p><p>"Only house I own is the events house in the Bay Area," Musk tweets, "If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The home</a> is rented from the billionaire's aerospace manufacturing company, SpaceX and is located near their facilities in&nbsp;Boca Chica, Texas.</p><p>The vision for Musk's new crib was made possible by a Las Vegas based startup manufacturing company calledBoxabl. Created in 2017 by&nbsp;Paolo Tiramani<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">,</a> Galiano Tiramani, and Kyle Denman,&nbsp; Boxable specializes the providing cost effective mini homes to those who live a more environmentally conscious lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Obsessively designed to the highest standards of quality, strength, and sustainability to last for generations," stated on the company's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a>, "the Boxabl mission is to significantly lower the cost of home ownership for everyone."</p><p>If you've been following Musk's Twitter feed, you're probably aware of the billionaire's tiffs with California that sparked his decision to sell his property. After the state disobeyed COVID restrictions - reopening Telsa's to the public during the height of quarantine - the CEO had enough.</p><p>"Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately," he tweets, "Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA."</p><p>Musk also states that he's looking to spend more time worry about making a healthier Earth and taking the human race to the stars.</p><p>"Working on sustainable energy for Earth with Tesla & protecting future of consciousness by making life multiplanetary with SpaceX," he responds to a Twitter user.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Compared to his elite contemporaries, the property portfolio of the world's wealthiest is pretty incredible. With an abundance of properties across the nation, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has a real estate portfolio of&nbsp;$500 million. Bernard Arnault currently owns five homes in California with a combined worth of&nbsp;$125 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernard Arnault Takes Elon Musk's Spot For Second Richest Man In The World</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill</a>, <a href=#>Forbes</a>, <a href=#>Chron</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvqrjLoqanmZmnsm6xy6ilZqWlqLhuuMivoKefXaeyr8DEnWRuaJtitbC5xGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./princess-leonor-of-spain-13-gives-first-royal-speech.html><span>←</span><span>Princess Leonor of Spain, 13, Gives First Royal Speech</span></a>
