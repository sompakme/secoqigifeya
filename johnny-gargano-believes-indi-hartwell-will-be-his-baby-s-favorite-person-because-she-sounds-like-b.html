When asked about the kid’s television shows dominating his household, Gargano spoke in-depth about the <a href=# rel=noopener>Disney</a> show Bluey.</p><p>“Literally 24 hours a day, Bluey is on in my house, Bluey or <a href=# rel=noopener>Spidey and His Amazing Friends</a>, which I’m pushing a lot as well. But Bluey is amazing,” Johnny Gargano said. “It’s an amazing show. And I would say if you’re a dad out there, if you’re a mom out there, even if you don’t have a kid out there, watch Bluey. It is a great television show, just saying. Watch it. It’s a great show.”</p><p>When asked about the premise of Bluey, Gargano couldn’t really explain it but said Bluey’s Australian accent is going to lead to Indi Hartwell being his son Quill’s favorite person.</p><p>“No, I can’t tell you what the premise is. It’s a great show. Life lessons, I guess,” Johnny Gargano said. “You want to learn about life? You want to learn about life in Australia? That’s another thing; it’s an Australian-based show. Which is why my theory is that Indi is going to end up being Quill’s favorite person because she talks like Bluey. She has the Australian accent. So obviously, in the long run, Indi is going to be Quill’s favorite person. So but yeah, it’s a great show, though. I highly recommend it.”</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Indi Hartwell, Satin expressed hope that she would be called up to the WWE main roster soon. Something that Gargano completely agreed with as he believes she’s ready to come up.</p><p>“I think it’s about time,” Johnny Gargano said. “Indi has been ready for a long time. Indi is amazingly talented. I mean, whenever you look at Indi, whenever that light comes on, she has something about her, and I can’t put my finger on it. We could never put our finger on it. She just has that — they talk about “it” a lot, right? They talk about this magical “it” thing out there. I don’t know what it is but when you see it on camera, they’re like, oh, there it is. Indi just has this thing about her. She is incredibly entertaining. incredibly funny. I think for my money, she is a complete package. And I thought for a long time that she was ready, and I think she’s definitely ready for bigger and better things.”</p><p>What do you make of Johnny Gargano’s comments?
