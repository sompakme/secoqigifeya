Anyone who knows Charlie knows exactly what I’m talking about. I’m terrified of him.”</span></p><p>Sheen revealed he was HIV-positive during an interview on the <i>Today</i> show last month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>As previously reported by </span><b>Us Weekly,</b><span> the former adult film star is suing the </span><i>Two and a Half Men</i><span> alum for assault and battery, emotional distress, false imprisonment, and negligence. Rossi claims in her lawsuit that Sheen failed to inform her prior to sex that he’s HIV-positive, and that he forced her to get an abortion so that they wouldn’t have a “retarded” child.</span></p><p>“Because of him, I’ve lost my dignity, I’ve had to completely find myself again, I’ve had to go through months and months of therapy. I have nightmares,” an emotional Rossi revealed to<i> Fox News.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“If I have to sacrifice myself to lead the way for every woman to have a voice, then it doesn’t matter [what people think of me] … don’t be scared … because then they win. I’m not scared of the truth and he knows the truth,” she added, explaining that she’s not suing Sheen because of his diagnosis, but because of the alleged abuse she suffered.<span><br></span></p><p><span>“I want justice,” Rossi said. “If i wanted money, I would have kept our child. If I wanted money, I would’ve kept quiet … the reason why I’m going against him in court is because what he did to me and how it will affect me for the rest of my life … the big picture is he has a violent and aggressive behavioral condition that I really hope he seeks help for.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span>According to Sheen’s lawyer, </span><b>Martin D. Singer</b><span>, the actor plans on fighting Rossi’s claims.</span></p><p>“Charlie Sheen intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit filed by Scottine Ross,” Singer said in a statement to Us on Thursday, Dec.3. “We are confident that Mr. Sheen will prevail in this action and will prevail on his claims for affirmative relief against her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpWpwW6%2BzqyqomWjlsa0edKhnGarpZuzpr7SZp2rp51ivbW%2Fw2adqKScpMSqusZmmqGZoqG2pnnSoZyepl2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1urcGoqa2hn6N6uH2UcmdraF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bob-odenkirk-learn-he-is-related-to-king-charles.html><span>←</span><span>Bob Odenkirk Learn He Is Related to King Charles</span></a>
