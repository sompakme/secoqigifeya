The diss could be a publicity stunt to attract attention for both artists and their upcoming albums.   Travis and Rihanna's brief relationship seems to have fizzled out, as they have both moved on and had children with other partners.      There was a brief time in 2015 when Travis Scott and Rihanna were romantically involved, and now it appears to be coming back to haunt the rapper, after Rihanna’s current partner ASAP Rocky appeared to take a dig at Travis during a recent performance."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Yeah, there’s a lot of things we’re going to collaborate on, from products for children.”</p><p>Though she’s been featured in his music video (and he’s modeled for her Fenty brands), the parents have never released a song together.

However, considering how briefly her rumored romance with Travis Scott was, Rocky’s diss towards him may seem random (which could be another sign it’s a publicity stunt, not real beef).</p><p>During their short-lived relationship, Travis nad Rihanna were spotted getting cozy while partying together on a few occasions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“They are definitely together. They were dancing very close and didn’t care who could see them,” <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a source told Page Six at the time</a>.</p><p>However, the romance appeared to fizzle out as quickly as it started. Rihanna and Travis have never publicly commented on what happened between them.</p><p>The pair have clearly moved on in recent years. Travis shares two children with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kylie Jenner</a>, whom he broke up with last year. ASAP Rocky and Rihanna welcomed their first child, son RZA, last year and are currently expecting baby no. 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYrJmgYr%2Bwr8qyZJ2ho6iytHnTq5ivoaNiwKS7061kqZ2im7yzucCnmp5lpKeyosDEnWSroZiWu6%2BtjKucpZmknryvv8eip2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-ways-rebel-wilson-earns-and-spends-her-fortune.html><span>←</span><span>8 Ways Rebel Wilson Earns And Spends Her Fortune</span></a>
