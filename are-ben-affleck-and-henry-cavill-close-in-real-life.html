And in the case of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Henry Cavill</strong></a> and Ben Affleck, it was two huge names as two huge heroes -- which made the speculation even more intense that the pair likely didn't get along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So what's their relationship really like off the set?</p><h2 id=does-henry-cavill-like-ben-affleck>Does Henry Cavill Like Ben Affleck?</h2><p>Before they appeared as Superman and Batman respectively, Henry and Ben hadn't worked together. But Henry had plenty of ideas about Ben's talents, and in every interview, he elaborated on how excited he was to work with the esteemed actor and director (good thing he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't quit acting beforehand</a>).</p><p>In fact, some publications even razzed Henry for being so enthusiastic about Ben. Calling him "googly-eyed" over Affleck, one publication <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quoted Cavill</a>&nbsp;as saying that his soon-to-be co-star would be "fantastic" for a specific reason. Henry noted, "Jobs like this require strength of character, they require a dedication to the work and a belief in oneself. And Ben has that, clearly."</p><p>Despite his tumultuous history in the public eye, Henry was game for acting alongside Ben, and maybe he&nbsp;was a bit starry-eyed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-ben-affleck-like-henry-cavill>Does Ben Affleck Like Henry Cavill?</h2><p>With headlines like 'Ben Affleck swears he'll never do another interview with Henry Cavill,' what are fans to think about Affleck's opinion of his co-star? They shouldn't believe everything they read.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Fans Think Jennifer Lopez Is Moving Way Too Fast With Ben Affleck" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think Jennifer Lopez Is Moving Way Too Fast With Ben Affleck</a></span></p><p>That same publication that alleged Ben was unhappy with Henry was just speculating and twisting his words. What Ben&nbsp;really said was that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had learned</a> not to keep his mouth shut and look sad while Henry answered questions.</p><p>Remember that "sad Ben" meme when critics ravaged 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'? That's what Ben was lamenting -- not his co-star being by his side. Clearly, the tabloids like to stoke the imaginary fire when it comes to bashing celebrity relationships.</p><p>So what's the truth?</p><h2 id=are-ben-affleck-and-henry-cavill-friends>Are Ben Affleck And Henry Cavill Friends?</h2><p>It&nbsp;does sound like Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill were friendly while working together. And though critics panned their first film, the pair went on to work together in 'Justice League,' which Ben also executive produced, plus 'Zack Snyder's Justice League.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, the two get along well and said yes to further collaboration even after their high-grossing yet critically dissed movie came out. It seems that Cavill maintains his high opinion of Batman, and Ben doesn't have anything negative to say about Superman, either.</p><p>Of course, just because they worked together on some reasonably successful films doesn't mean they're BFFs off the set. Though Ben posted cute pics of the pair together during filming, they don't seem like the type of pals who still hang after their movies are finished. Although, Ben is probably happy to help Henry out career-wise (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans suggest his success might be waning</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's a bummer for fans, but at least both gents still speak highly of one another, outside the superhero realm.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's Why Fans Think Henry Cavill Is Coming To Marvel" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Fans Think Henry Cavill Is Coming To Marvel</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dl7KvecCfnaWdk6B6orrDZp%2BepqKueqSt1aKjpWWWp7amusOsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-gets-revenge-on-billie-eilish-amid-their-rumored-feud-by-squashing-her-album-sales.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Gets Revenge On Billie Eilish Amid Their Rumored Feud By Squashing Her Album Sales</span></a>
