But there’s something else she’s crooning about this time around, too: her fabulous style!</p><p>Since her permanent move to NYC in March 2014, the “Shake It Off” singer, 24, has been <a href=#>strutting her lithe figure around the Big Apple</a> in retro-inspired ensembles that include an endless supply of crop tops and fit-and-flare skirts. And she hardly ever leaves the house—even to go to the gym!—without her <a href=#>perfect red statement lip</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And because she obviously takes a little extra time in the morning making sure she’s picture-perfect, it’s no wonder her dedication inspired some chic song lyrics that reference all of her favorite things: red lips, pretty dresses, and the boys who should have appreciated both more! Here are the six times T-Swizz references her ever-ladylike sartorial senses in 1989‘s song lyrics:</p><p>“Cherry lips, crystal skies. I could show you incredible things.” —”Blank Space”</p><p>Because if there’s one lady with a steady supply of red lipstick and a passport, it’s Taylor Swift. (Watch her perform it at the iHeartRadio and Yahoo Live Secret Session on Oct. 27 above!)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye. And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like.” —“Style”</p><p>Still loving her red lips! But calling out her throwback looks, too. (<a href=#>Did you see her Grease look on Jimmy Kimmel Live?</a>)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“You got that long hair slicked back, white T-shirt. And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt.” —”Style”</p><p>She hoped that her closet of sparkly miniskirts would keep her romance moving in, ahem, one direction. (They would have worked on us, Tay!)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Say you’ll remember me, standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe.” —”Wildest Dreams”</p><p>New York’s new style ambassador loves herself a pretty dress with florals, the perfect ensemble to take in the sun setting over the Hudson (from your $20 million penthouse apartment, natch).</p><p>“Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you’ll see me again, even if it’s just in your wildest dreams.” —”Wildest Dreams”</p><p>And the red lips are back! This time, with Swift’s blushed cheeks. Not that this boy’s going to see those anytime soon, sniff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Your necklace hanging from my neck, the night we couldn’t quite forget. When we decided to move the furniture so we could dance, baby, like we stood a chance. Two paper airplanes flying, flying…” —”Out of the Woods”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>You know which two stars wore the same paper plane necklace?
