They were so heavy that they had to be handled and shipped by a professional. It wasn't until after the World Wars that luggage sets became lighter and smaller, making it possible for an individual to carry them around. That was about the same time when the first carry-on suitcases and wheeled bags were invented. However, we've come a long way since. Nowadays, luggage sets have taken a whole new form. Functionality doesn't play the primary role anymore. It has been replaced by elegance, style, and quality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Often enough, the journey is more important than the destination, which means you must choose your travel companions wisely. The ultimate travel accessory, nothing reads elegance better than a high-end luggage set. Forget about struggling to discern your bag from all the other identical and dull ones in the baggage claim area. A luxury travel accessory will definitely make you stand out in the crowd.
