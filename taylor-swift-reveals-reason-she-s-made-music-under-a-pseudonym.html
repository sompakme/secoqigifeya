“I think when a pseudonym comes in is when you still have a love for making the work, and you don’t want the work to become overshadowed by this thing that’s been built around you, based on what people know about you,” the 30-year-old Grammy winner said in the interview published on Friday, November 13."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I wrote this song called ‘This Is What You Came For’ that <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a> ended up singing. And nobody knew for a while.”</p><p>Swift added, “I remembered always hearing that when <a href=#>Prince</a> wrote ‘Manic Monday,’ they didn’t reveal it for a couple of months.”</p><p>The English icon applauded Swift’s choice by sharing that he has also used a pseudonym to work on music. “Yeah, it also proves you can do something without the fame tag. I did something for Peter and Gordon; my girlfriend’s brother and his mate were in a band called Peter and Gordon. And I used to write under the name Bernard Webb,” he said.</p><p>Swift <a href=#>first used the faux moniker</a> while working on ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Calvin Harris</strong></a>’ EDM track “This Is What You Came For” in 2016 <a href=#>before their split was announced that year</a>. Though it had initially been a secret, the “Shake It Off” singer’s rep <a href=#>confirmed her involvement</a> on the song months after its release.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Scottish DJ, 36, later <a href=#>revealed that Swift also “sings on a little bit of it too,”</a> but he didn’t specify where her vocals appear. “<a href=#>Amazing lyric writer</a> and she smashed it as usual,” he tweeted at the time. “I wrote the music, produced the song, arranged it and cut the vocals though. And initially she wanted it kept secret, hence the pseudonym.”</p><p>Earlier this year, Swift produced a cover of her 2017 single “Look What You Made Me Do” under her Swedish-inspired pseudonym for <a href=#>Killing Eve</a>. The rendition was recorded by a nonexistent band called Jack Leopards & The Dolphin Club. Swifties quickly theorized that the <a href=#>Cats</a> actress, <a href=#>her brother, <strong>Austin Swift</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Jack Antonoff</strong></a> — who is also listed as a producer on the song — were behind the band’s creation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWimsOmrcusZKudkai8r3nSoZysZZ2WsaZ5zK6qoptdqrulsdFmmGaoo5rCpbvNsqRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pbso-woman-forced-into-car-sparks-amber-alert-issued-for-2-kids.html><span>←</span><span>PBSO: Woman forced into car sparks Amber Alert issued for 2 kids</span></a>
