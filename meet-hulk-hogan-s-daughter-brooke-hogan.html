Over the course of the last decade, Hogan has also released two studio albums- Undiscovered (2006) and The Redemption (2009).&nbsp;</p><p>The Redemption is notable as her father co-wrote it amid a difficult period between them. Her latest single, “Hulkamania” was written with legendary producer David Banner and spoke of forgiveness and reconnecting with one another – themes that music fans have come to know Brooke for.</p><p>The success of Hogan’s one-off special in 2003 proved that audiences were ready to devour her family’s adventures, and they quickly became stars.&nbsp;</p><p>The documentary-style show Hogan Knows Best (2005–07) followed teenage Brooke as she sought to make it big in music. In 2006 she released her debut studio album, Undiscovered, with its lead single “About Us” peaking at number twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite being surrounded by her parents and brother throughout the series, it was Brooke and her accomplishments that took centre stage.&nbsp;</p><p>With the release of her second studio album, The Redemption, in 2009 came two singles, but neither achieved the same popularity as “About Us.”</p><p>Following her departure from the reality show, Brooke Hogan ventured out into the world of acting.&nbsp;</p><p>She appeared in numerous low-budget movies and TV series, where she made cameos. When that wasn’t enough to satisfy her hunger for <a href=#>entertainment</a>, she decided to team up with her father in 2012 and join Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, a whole season was not enough to keep her around. After being cut loose, Brooke Hogan decided to attempt comedy by appearing in the comedic film L.A. Slasher in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to this movie, she also released two extended plays featuring country music, one in 2015 and another one in 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Hulk Hogan paralyzed?</h2><p>Hulk Hogan’s health has deteriorated since he stopped competing in professional wrestling in 2012, and recently the former Olympian Kurt Angle discussed the condition of Hulk Hogan’s health while they were filming WWE’s Monday Night Raw 30th Anniversary show.&nbsp;</p><p>In their conversation, Kurt Angle shared that Hogan had undergone back surgery and that his lower body’s nerves had been severed, leaving him unable to feel any sensation or pain in his legs.&nbsp;</p><p>Kurt also noted that, as a result, Hulk was forced to use a cane for mobility assistance. The anniversary broadcast which features their discussion is scheduled to air on January 23rd, 2023.</p><p>It is sure to be an emotional one as many will hopefully gain insight into the current state of one of wrestling’s greatest icons.</p><p>During the 2021 anniversary program, shock waves spread across the media when attendees caught a glimpse of Hulk Hogan crossing the stage unaided.&nbsp;</p><p>Kurt’s podcast that aired days after suggested that the former <a href=#>WWE</a> star had suffered extensive injuries and was struggling to walk.&nbsp;</p><p>However, a spokesperson for Hulk Hogan quickly issued a statement contradicting Kurt’s claims, citing Hulk’s sense of humor and broad access to treatments as evidence of his recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this clarification, media outlets continued to speculate on Hulk Hogan’s condition, citing 25 surgeries Kakt reportedly had between 2011 and 2021. With conflicting reports emerging, it remains unclear what impact WWE medical-based treatments have had on Hulk Hogan’s recovery.</p><p>In an episode of the Hollywood Raw podcast in October 2021, Hulk’s daughter Brooke Hogan revealed that her father had undergone about 25 surgeries in the previous ten years.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=4.5><p><strong>“He’s had both shoulders scoped, and he had his whole bicep … and everything tied up in his shoulder last year,” she said, adding, “That was a disaster. He got MRSA, and it was like a big thing. So we had to go back.”</strong></p></figure><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC01KWiZqCfnK6vecOarKCgpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dick-van-dyke-net-worth-how-much-is-van-dyke-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Dick Van Dyke Net Worth How Much is Van Dyke Worth?</span></a>
