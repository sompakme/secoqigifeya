Mo'Nique is to be the last mother--king person on the god damn stage. She is the headliner. That's what I signed the contract for," Mo’Nique shouted.</p><p>The Precious actress then inexplicably waded into a homophobic rant, even though D. L. is happily married to a woman with whom he shares three children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“N--ga, your name is D.L., what the f--k does it stand for?"

Lesson learned. I didn’t have anything personal against Monique… People paid a lot of money to laugh, not hear about your contract. Apparently, the role you played in PRECIOUS turned out to be an autobiography. I wonder who’s next…”</p><p>The former Dancing with the Stars contestant cheekily paired his response with a picture of Mo’Nique in her role as the antagonist in Precious.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kevin Hart Way: The Comedian's 10 Rules To Achieve Success</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HNHH</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxbriMoaygoJyaxm6vy5qnrGWSlrCsecCtZKannp6%2BtrGMqK2eql2YvK%2FA0ZqarWWUnsCxwdOeZKKso2LGsMGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coolio-s-gangsta-s-paradise-hits-one-billion-youtube-views.html><span>←</span><span>Coolios &amp;quot;Gangstas Paradise&amp;quot; Hits One Billion YouTube Views</span></a>
