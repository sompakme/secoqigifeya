The infamous slap happened after comedian Chris Rock made a joke about <strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong>'s shaved hair during the ceremony, only to be then slapped by her irate husband<strong> Will Smith</strong>, who then proceeded to fire obscenities at Rock. The assault completely overshadowed the awards that evening, and after the clip of the incident went viral, it seemed that the slap was set to go down, as Chris himself joked, as <a href=#>one of the greatest nights in the history of television</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Will Smith Takes Trip—But Not To Chris Rock’s House To Apologize">Will Smith Takes Trip—But Not To Chris Rock’s House To Apologize</a></span></p><p>Though Smith later made a public apology and received a <a href=#>10-year ban</a> from the Oscars (<a href=#>despite keeping his Best Actor award</a>), many continue to be appalled by the assault - perhaps no-one less than Chris Rock's mother. Rosalie Rock, 77, gave an interview to NBC affiliate <a href=#>WIS of Columbia</a> recently, in which she damned Smith for his actions.</p><h2 id=rose-was-unimpressed-by-the-incident><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rose Was Unimpressed By The Incident</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Opening up on the show,</a> Rosalie 'Rose' Rock explained her immediate reaction to seeing the slap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Watching the event from home, Rock said that she initially assumed that the slap was staged and all part of the act. As Smith then began his tirade of expletive-ridden abuse, it dawned on her that this was quite real - her son Chris had been assaulted live on national television.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Chris Rock Has A History Of Making Fun Of Jada Pinkett Smith">Chris Rock Has A History Of Making Fun Of Jada Pinkett Smith</a></span></p><h2 id=she-had-this-to-say-about-it><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Had This To Say About It</span></h2><p>“You reacted to your wife giving you the side-eye and you went and made her day because she was mulled over laughing when it happened,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock told host Billie Jean Shaw, speaking about Smith.</a></p><p>"When Will slapped Chris, he slapped all of us.

You [Will] really could have gotten taken out in handcuffs. You didn't think. You reacted to your wife giving you the side-eye, and you went up, and you made her day because she was bowled over laughing when it happened." she said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Terry Crews Believes Chris Rock 'Saved Hollywood' Following Oscar Slap">Terry Crews Believes Chris Rock 'Saved Hollywood' Following Oscar Slap</a></span></p><h2 id=will-smith-39-s-mom-has-also-been-shocked-by-39-slapgate-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Will Smith's Mom Has Also Been Shocked By 'Slapgate'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Will Smith's own mother has expressed surprise about her son's outburst, and explained in an interview that it was quite out of character for the I Am Legend actor, who she describes as typically mild-mannered and friendly.</p><p>“He is a very even, people person,” she told <a href=#>WPVI</a>. “That’s the first time I’ve ever seen him go off. First time in his lifetime... I’ve never seen him do that.”</p><p>Though it was difficult for her to watch, she said that she was still "proud of him being him" and was delighted for his best actor win that night.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Are Looking Back At This 'Fresh Prince' Scene Following The Will Smith And Chris Rock Moment">Fans Are Looking Back At This 'Fresh Prince' Scene Following The Will Smith And Chris Rock Moment</a></span></p><h2 id=rose-thinks-that-smith-39-s-10-year-ban-is-not-enough><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Rose Thinks That Smith's 10-Year Ban Is Not Enough</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rose also gave her two cents on Smith's ban from the academy, stating that she didn't think it went far enough and was a meaningless punishment.</p><p>Referencing the <a href=#>10-year Oscar ban</a> the King Richard star received, she` said, "What does that mean?

When questioned by a fellow Twitter user with "Do you approve of the apology?", Tony bluntly replied "No."</p><p>Another user wrote: "@TONYROCK Let Bro know he’s a better man than people give him credit for. As bad as the situation was, it could have gone completely sideways if he hadn’t been the adult in the room,", to which Tony Rock re-tweeted with a peace sign emoji.</p><p>"Be sure to watch ‘Good Hair’ since the narrative is now changed to all my bro does is disrespect women of color," Tony Rock later <a href=#>wrote</a> in support of his brother, encouraging fans to watch the Chris Rock documentary in which he positively explores the culture of black women's hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Why Will Smith Slapping Chris Rock Could Be A Good Thing For The Oscars">Why Will Smith Slapping Chris Rock Could Be A Good Thing For The Oscars</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrCpvsisZKunk6B6rrvMZqqaoZRirqO71K1kqKuTlr%2B0edKlmKllp565rXnSpqCtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tko-merges-wwe-and-ufc-global-partnerships-teams.html><span>←</span><span>TKO Merges WWE And UFC Global Partnerships Teams</span></a>
