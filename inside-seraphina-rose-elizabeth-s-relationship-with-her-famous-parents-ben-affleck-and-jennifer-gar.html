We all want to pass on the best of ourselves to our children. I don’t care who you are, I’m quite sure you feel at some point in your life you’ve taken missteps, nobody wants to transfer that to our children and that is a real task that everybody faces, whatever those issues are, he said in an interview with Good Morning America.</p><h2 id=how-often-is-seraphina-rose-elizabeth-with-jennifer-garner><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Often Is Seraphina Rose Elizabeth with Jennifer Garner?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jennifer-garner-walking-home-with-her-kids-seraphina-and-samuel.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jennifer and Ben share custody of their kids, there was a large portion of their relationship where Jennifer was really being both parents for their children. Before Ben got sober, a lot of the parental responsibility fell on Jennifer’s shoulders. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the aftermath of her divorce, Jennifer said</a> “I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It’s something that we are working through.”</p><p>It may have taken some time to get adjusted, but Jennifer seems to have the whole mom thing on lock these days. She can be spotted on her TikTok and Instagram whipping up fun, healthy lunches for her kids.</p><p>Jennifer and Ben also have an amazing co-parenting relationship now. “They stay on top of things and have a lot of meetings and check-ins. They want to be the best parents they can for the kids. If they have differences, they keep it to themselves and don’t let it have an impact. They always put on happy faces for the kids and put their well-being first,” a source close to the family told Us Weekly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-seraphina-rose-elizabeth-get-along-with-jennifer-lopez><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Does Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Get Along With Jennifer Lopez?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/emme-maribel-mun-iz-and-seraphina-affleck-going-to-a-movie-together-2021-la.jpg><p>We don’t know Seraphina Rose Elizabeth’s true feelings about Jennifer Lopez because they have never expressed them publicly. They have <a href=#>become incredibly close with Jennifer’s children</a>, with Seraphina and Emme being spotted together frequently. From school drop-offs, to holding hands while walking around downtown Los Angeles, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the pair seem to have hit it off</a>.</p><p>The two have a very similar sense of style and are only a year apart, which surely aided in their quick kinship. They also both identify as non-binary and prefer the use of they/them pronouns. While it’s never been confirmed by Emme, Seraphina, or their parents, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans believe that Emme was pivotal in helping Seraphina come to terms with her gender</a> and begin using non-binary pronouns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Lopez has been incredibly supportive of Emme as she navigates her teenage years. She performed with them at the Los Angeles Dance Foundation’s Blue Diamond Gala where she introduced Emme using non-binary pronouns for the first time.</p><p>“The last time we performed together was in a big stadium like this and I ask them to sing with me all the time, and they won’t,” Jennifer said to the crowd at the Gala. “So this is a very special occasion. They are very, very busy. Booked. And pricey. They cost me when they come out. But they’re worth every single penny because they’re my favorite duet partner of all time. So if you will indulge me.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Stars Who Have Come Out As Non-Binary</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben and Jennifer were keen on ensuring their families seamlessly blended together after their nuptials, and seeing how close Emme and Seraphina have become must warm their hearts. “Since Jennifer and Ben are in it for the long run, it‘s just a natural step that they all spend time together with the kids,” a source close to the couple said to People Magazine.</p><p>The couple has been lining up plans for them and their children to help keep them all connected and form true bonds. “They are not trying to rush anything, but they want all the kids to get to know each other,” said the source.</p><h2 id=does-seraphina-rose-elizabeth-want-to-be-an-actor-like-their-parents><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Does Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Want To Be An Actor Like Their Parents?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ben-affleck-on-a-walk-with-seraphina-affleck-in-2020.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben Affleck has actively discouraged his children from becoming actors. He especially doesn’t want them doing it while they’re still children. Speaking at the AutFest Film Festival, Ben said, “I love being an actor, I got into it as a child and I wouldn’t change that. But I also wouldn’t want to take my kids and push them out there before they were 18. If they are 18 and they want to make those choices and do that kind of thing, that’s fine. But being a child actor, I just know too much of the downside of what that can be like.”</p><h2 id=will-seraphina-rose-elizabeth-be-going-to-college><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Will Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Be Going To College?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ben-affleck-spotted-with-emme-muniz-and-seraphina-affleck-in-2021.jpg><p>Seraphina Rose Elizabeth is only 14-years-old, so they won’t be going to college anytime soon, but Jennifer and Ben have both hinted that they want their kids to receive top-tier education. Both Ben and Jennifer attended college, so one could assume they would want the same experience for their children. It was at college that Ben found his love for directing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-seraphina-rose-elizabeth-want-their-mother-jennifer-garner-to-get-married-again><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Does Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Want Their Mother Jennifer Garner To Get Married Again?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jennifer-garner-walking-with-her-daughter-seraphina-rose-elizabeth-affleck-in-la-2021.jpg><p>None of Jennifer Garner’s kids have publicly stated whether or not they want their mother to get married again. Jennifer has been linked to John Miller, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with the two having an on-and-off again relationship since 2018</a>. Surely, if their mother was happy Seraphina would encourage her to do whatever she thinks is best.</p><h2 id=seraphina-rose-elizabeth-calls-their-mother-jennifer-garner-a-fun-killer><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Calls Their Mother Jennifer Garner A Fun Killer</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/seraphina-affleck-and-jennifer-garner-spotted-in-los-angeles-2021.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Garner is a super-mom, but maybe not a super fun one. She has rules, and she sticks to them, whether her kids like it or not. Jennifer shared that her daughter Seraphina once wrote her a letter saying she hopes to be a fun-killing mom just like Jennifer is when she grows up. “I am so lame. I say ‘No’ to everything. They call me the dragon. They have all these names for me,” said Jennifer on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqqRpbWqusBmqairlWKyrbXZmpmerJhirqeyy56apGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6uLXToWSpmaKau7W%2FjJucp2WamruvtcWeqWafkae7pr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./football-s-future-forum-the-ultimate-destination-for-football-discussions.html><span>←</span><span>Footballs Future Forum: The Ultimate Destination for Football Discussions</span></a>
