Thank you all for your support and kindness.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dean’s post was accompanied by a slideshow of throwback photos of him and Tori. At the time, Tori didn’t release a statement of her own.</p><p>During their nearly two-decades of marriage, Dean and Tori welcomed five children. They’ve shared much of their personal life on reality television, including how they navigated <a href=#>Dean’s cheating scandals and sex addiction.</a></p><p>Known for starring in 90210 (and being the daughter of famed TV producer Aaron Spelling), Tori has an <a href=#>estimated net worth of $1.5 million</a>. Dean, whose starred in movies like Kiss the Bride and Open Range, has a <a href=#>net worth of $3 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, Tori and Dean never signed a prenup prior to getting married. "Dean offered to sign one, but Tori refused. She truly believed Dean was her soul mate and there was zero need for a prenup," <a href=#>a source said in 2014</a>.</p><p>At the time, the couple was navigating a public scandal after Dean allegedly had an affair. Even stil, the source said Tori didn’t want a divorce.</p><p>"With the recent allegations that Dean cheated on Tori, she is now kicking herself for not securing the prenup with Dean,” the insider explained. “She doesn't plan on divorcing Dean, but feels that a prenup might could have prevented him from cheating on her."</p><p>However, hope may not be lost for this long-time couple. Shortly after sharing the divorce announcement to Instagram, Dean deleted the post. Moreover, <a href=#>sources claim the couple aren’t divorcing</a>, contrary to what Dean said in his post. It remains to be seen if this long-time couple will work things out (again).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner’s Business Sued Again, This Time By Model Who Didn’t Get Paid</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, <a href=#>Business Standard</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxpq3NZqScnJWnurDA02aYp6afqruksdJmm6Kun6ewpnnFq6amZaSkv6p50qmcpaSZo7RurtStZKKsXaKuunnGnqtmpZWowLp51qKroaelqXqxvsSnrKln</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billionaire-wants-70-million-for-basquiat-painting.html><span>←</span><span>Billionaire Wants $70 Million For Basquiat Painting</span></a>
