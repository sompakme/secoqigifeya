Simply put, there’s no one out there that can relate to the elusive singer. For years, she’s proven to be one of the biggest and if not interesting stars due to the way she conducts herself in public, her appearance, and, of course, the rumors about her diva-like behavior. The woman is an icon, but her iconic attitude is definitely not a positive thing. And while a lot of people have given her plenty of side eyes and shade over the way she acts, let’s not forget that Mariah is also one of the most talented artists the world has ever seen. No one can carry a tune the same way she can. She may be full of herself, but her talent is undeniable and is very rarely matched.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And even though Mariah has a multi-million dollar bank account to match her multi-million dollar voice, a lot of people wouldn’t say that she has a multi-million dollar wardrobe. Instead, Mariah Carey often ends up on the worst-dressed list instead of the best-dressed one whenever she hits the red carpet. For her entire career, Mariah Carey has gone for the tackiest and trashiest outfits she could find. You’d think that she would learn how to dress like a diva by now, but sadly that hasn’t happened. With that being said, we’ve got 15 of Mariah Carey’s most questionable outfits listed here.</p><h2 id=pleather-or-leather>Pleather Or Leather?</h2><p>Whenever we see <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> from her early days, her outfits make us cringe a little. And that’s not because she’s not wearing them right or that she didn’t have the body to pull off her ensembles. Instead, it’s because she was always a bit on the cheesy side. She would mix a bunch of styles together, add shoes that were always too small for her feet and step out in public thinking that she looked great. She looks beautiful here, but her look is so 1999 if you ask us.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of Mariah’s beauty, the singer says that she didn’t always have it easy. She once said, “My father identified as a black man. No one asked him because he was clearly black. But people always ask me. If we were together, people would look at us in a really strange way. It sucked. As a little girl, I had blond hair and they'd look at me, look at him, and be disgusted.”</p><h2 id=mad-for-plaid>Mad For Plaid</h2><p>Oh, Mariah. With all of the money in your bank account, you’d think that the girl could invest in a few good mirrors. And we are not talking about the kind of mirrors that make you look thinner in retail stores. This is just a big fat no. No one should wear a dress that looks better as a blanket or a rug. And don’t even get me started on that hideous belt. Gross.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of rugs, Mariah once opened up about how insecure she used to feel during her early days in the entertainment world. She said, “I always felt like the rug could be pulled out from under me at any time. And coming from a racially mixed background, I always felt like I didn't really fit in anywhere.”</p><h2 id=not-her-most-flattering-look>Not Her Most Flattering Look</h2><p>A lot can be said about Mariah Carey, but if there’s one thing that you can’t really say, it’s that she has good taste in fashion. These photos prove that she is a very disillusioned human being. No human being on this planet should wear a leotard with stockings in public. It looks incredibly unflattering on everyone, to say the least.</p><p>We can’t understand why, but somehow Mariah doesn’t pay much attention to her critics. She’s going to wear a leotard on stage regardless of what others have to say about it. She said, “It's not easy that everything you do, everybody has to come in and critique it and give their opinion. Sometimes it does help me and sometimes it hurts me as a person. That's life. I have feelings.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-that-glitters>All That Glitters</h2><p>At this point, it’s safe to say that Mariah Carey has some sort of fixation with leotards and pantyhose. It’s as if pants really don’t matter to her! And while this leotard is slightly better than the one she wore above, it’s still pretty outrageous. We can’t picture another diva like <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> or even <a href=#>Celine Dion</a> wearing something like this on stage. In fact, we don’t know anyone who would wear this, period!</p><p>Mariah knows that she has a reputation. And she’s not afraid to admit to it, either. She said, “I know I can be diva-ish sometimes, but I have to be in control. The nature of my life, the nature of what I do, is divadom, it really is. I'm proud of what I am and who I am, and I'm just going to be myself.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=snake-skin>Snake Skin</h2><p>Mariah Carey loves to show off her curves. In fact, she’s known to have worn super short mini-skirts in freezing cold weather. And while we’ll give her a pass for looking pretty sexy in this photo, her outfit is a huge, big, undeniably fat no. Everything from the Lucite heels to the snakeskin top and skirt just makes her look cheap and trashy. And if there’s something that Mariah Carey doesn’t want to be, it’s cheap and trashy. She should know better.</p><p>Still, there’s no doubt that a lot of guys would love to see Mariah dressed up like this at their front door. Speaking about her love life, she said, “It's kind of like being on a roller coaster. If you don't get on the ride, you won't experience the adventure. See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow, make me sing real high when he goes down low.”</p><h2 id=snow-princess>Snow Princess</h2><p>When we told you that Mariah Carey loves the snow, we weren’t kidding. We’re surprised that Mariah hasn’t been named as an honorary resident of Park City, Utah because she sure does love to spend a lot of time over there! After all, Mariah is also known as the Queen of Christmas. It’s all part of her image and her public persona. I’m sure she even has the power to make it snow at any given moment, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while we can’t blame her for wanting to bundle up for the cold, we’re shaking our heads at those heels. Who on Earth would wear them while walking in the snow? Actually, we know who&nbsp;– her. It’s no wonder she always makes one of her assistants hold her whenever she’s walking in public.</p><h2 id=unflattering-red-pants>Unflattering Red Pants</h2><p>We apologize in advance for the visual. As much as we would love to forget that it ever happened, these photos will always exist on the Internet for a reason. For one, we can’t understand why Mariah Carey’s team of assistants and stylists hate her so much and second, didn’t she realize that this ensemble would get her into major trouble? Mariah, we thought you were smarter than this. Just because your stylist thinks it’s a good idea, that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea! We don’t want to see this!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As we all know, Mariah doesn’t like to talk too much about her personal life. She has said in the past, “I'm not one of those people that goes into details of my personal life on national TV to get attention. Some things are better left unsaid.”</p><h2 id=the-elusive-chanteuse>The Elusive Chanteuse</h2><p>In this photo, we really can’t tell what Mariah Carey’s deal is. Is she trying to be incognito? Or is she looking to play in an upcoming, modern version of Where In The World is Carmen Sandiego? Either way, this isn’t something you would normally see on someone like Mariah Carey. Also, what’s the point of wearing a winter coat if it’s going to be this short? But then again, the woman sure does love to show off her legs, right?</p><p>Mariah, as we all know, does things her way, no matter what others have to say about it. She’ll wear mini winter jackets if and when she wants. “You really have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength and say, 'I'm proud of what I am and who I am, and I'm just going to be myself,’” she once declared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cut-out-dress>Cut-Out Dress</h2><p>Now, we know that award shows like the Billboards or the Grammys often see some of our favorite celebrities wearing some of the most ridiculous things we’ve ever seen on the red carpet. Thankfully, Mariah Carey doesn’t disappoint. While we don’t understand what message she’s trying to send with this dress, what we do know is that even her stardom is too bright for her. I mean, you can totally tell that she’s having a hard time trying to see through those shades, right?</p><p>Plus, we’ve seen this look so many times on the red carpet in the past. It’s one she recycles quite often. Mariah once said, “I do not think I reinvent myself. Wearing my hair differently or changing my style of dress is playing dress-up. I don't take it too seriously.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=just-like-beyonce>Just Like Beyonce?</h2><p>If there’s one person who knows how to rock a serious leotard on stage, it’s Beyonce. Heck, <a href=#>Beyonce</a> could be wearing your grandmother’s pantyhose to the Grammys and she would still make it look stylish and sexy. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said about Mariah Carey. Now, we don’t know how much Photoshop was used for the photo, but let’s just say that Mariah isn’t fooling anyone.</p><p>Mariah insists that she’s not competing with anyone anymore. She knows who she is and for her, that’s enough. She’s said, “I definitely feel more complete than before. There's a void you have when you don't feel you've found the other part of who you are, so I'm in a different place now and that's nice to experience.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=las-vegas-style>Las Vegas Style</h2><p>If you tried to categorize Mariah Carey’s style, it would be pretty hard. That’s because she’s in a league of her own. And mind you, that’s not a league that a lot of other people would want to be in. One day, she’s an Aspen snow princess, the next day she’s your grandmother in see-through tights and then she’s a Las Vegas resident singer who likes to remind everyone why she has a long list of hits. As you can tell, Mariah is the latter in this picture. Mariah knows that she’s someone who will always be tabloid fodder. It comes with the territory, especially if you are a celebrity. She’s said, “Honestly, everybody gets talked about. Some people control their press a little more than others. Some people feed the press and move it the way they want to. I don't do that.”</p><h2 id=but-she-does-keep-it-subtle>But She Does Keep It Subtle</h2><p>You’d think that with all of the outrageous, bizarre and downright strange outfits that Mariah has worn in the past, her hair and makeup would look just as crazy! But that’s never been the case with this lamb. While she loves to be alluring&nbsp;with peek-a-boo leather dresses like the one that we see here, Mariah often keeps her hair and makeup routine the same. As a matter of fact, we would even go as far as saying that it’s subtle. And that’s a compliment, mind you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mariah once explained it this way, “If you're not wearing a lot of makeup, you don't have to take a lot of it off. So, my goal is to wear the least amount of makeup possible so I don't have to steam my face and take it all off.”</p><h2 id=the-michael-jackson>The Michael Jackson</h2><p>A lot of people might disagree with this, but there are only a handful of people that can wear leather jackets in public after a certain age. Unfortunately, Mariah Carey is not one of them.</p><p>We don’t know what Mariah Carey was trying to accomplish here, but we can tell you that the jacket is a no, the black tight pants are a no and the heels are a definite no, too. Heck, if we could, we would just erase this outfit altogether and start over again. Let’s not ruin Michael Jackson’s memory by trying to replicate his most iconic look by making it cheap and tacky. Plus, we don’t understand what her zipper is trying to do here. The King of Pop has had to deal with enough as it is!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=as-if>As If!</h2><p>Oh, Mariah. Pippi Longstocking called and she wants her braid back. Also, the poor, struggling artist who sells cheap Eiffel tower key chains in a tourist dump in Paris wants his hat back, too.</p><p>Of course, the only thing we have left to say is what you will find on the fan’s hat in this photo: AS IF. Mariah, you would look a whole lot better if you started acting and dressing your age. But then again, what good would that do? Mariah Carey is the way she is for a reason. If she started dressing like other singers and celebrities, we wouldn’t be enjoying all of her memorable, if not disastrous, outfits like this one. So with that being said, keep them coming, Mariah. Your closet truly is the gift that keeps on giving.</p><h2 id=too-much-of-everything>Too Much Of Everything</h2><p>We get it. Mariah Carey is a very confident woman. She’s so confident that she often wears clothes that either make her look too big and the rest of her body too small. In this case, it&nbsp;looks like Mariah is trying too hard to be provocative with this outfit, and it just isn't necessary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mariah says one of the reasons why she is so confident is because she grew up during a time that was a little different. She didn’t have to endure the same things that her siblings had to go through. She said, “My brother and sister had a much worse childhood, I think, because they were older, and they had to deal with a lot more racism because they grew up in the '70s and I grew up more in the '80s. So they had to deal with crosses being burned on their lawn and their dogs being poisoned.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ks265wKugmqBdmK6zsdisZLCnoqjBbrvUrZ2irKNiwamt02anq6emmnq0tMRmn5qrXaO8brLArJ%2Bip55iwaK%2F055m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dc-young-fly-s-partner-jacky-oh-gets-grand-send-off-at-funeral-servi.html><span>←</span><span> DC Young Fly's Partner Jacky Oh!
