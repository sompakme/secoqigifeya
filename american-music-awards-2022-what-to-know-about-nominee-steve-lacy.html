Ahead of his New Artist of the Year nomination at the <a href=#>2022 American Music Awards</a>, <strong>Steve Lacy</strong> made a name for himself with his music and fashion.</p><p>Lacy, 24, got his start making music <a href=#>at a young age before joining The Internet</a> alongside <strong>Sydney Bennett, Matthew Martin, Patrick Paige II </strong>and<strong> Christopher Smith</strong> in 2015. The songwriter coproduced eight songs for their third studio album, Ego Death.</p><p>After branching out into a solo career, the musician rose to stardom with his viral track Bad Habit. At the time, the record producer addressed <a href=#>his thoughts on his song finding fame through TikTok.</a></p><p>“I love it. I want everybody to listen. It’s dope for everybody to interpret it in their own way,” he told W Magazine in October. “Am I gonna spend my energy being mad about my song doing well on TikTok? No, I’m not. I’ll spend my energy being grateful and working on more stuff.”</p><p>Lacy noted that he appreciated <a href=#>seeing the response to his music in person</a>. “I love playing live because it shows me what is real. I remember when I played ‘Infrunami’ live, and everybody was singing! I was like, ‘This is crazy,'” he recalled. “Like, this is a f—king demo I made a long time ago. I couldn’t even sing that song when I wrote it. I used to record really low in my room in my mom’s house, because I didn’t want anyone to hear me. So a lot of my old recordings literally are me trying to sing softly.”</p><p>The Grammy award nominee, who was a musical guest on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> in November, revealed that a near-death experience influenced his songs.</p><p>“The realization that death defines the meaning of your life,” he told Another Magazine in September about his musical inspiration. “I feel like that near-death experience shifted everything in a way. I felt lighter afterwards. It made me look at my life. Like, what matters? What am I going to put my energy into?”</p><p>According to Lacy, his music <a href=#>gave him an “opportunity to tell a story”</a> to other people. “I look at my life as a museum, like experiences that I collect. How I touch people’s lives, the energy that I put out into this world. What will I do to keep that flowing?” he continued. [Music creates] a thread for someone else to continue, even when you’re gone. That’s what keeps me going. That’s what keeps it fun, because this won’t be forever.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lacy explained how he hoped his fans would continue <a href=#>to enjoy his “weird and challenging” music</a>. “My hope is to bring the artists back. People are always saying that our attention spans are getting smaller. I don’t believe that — I think the effort to make things that last long is dying,” he detailed, referring to his legacy. “So, I hope that people make things that will last, things that are sustainable.”</p><p>Scroll down for everything to know about the New Artist of the Year nominee for the 2022 American Music Awards:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWuqa%2ByJyYp2WdqsCqr4yarpqqlKh6c3yRa2SwoJGperW7jKSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmpailmaOypnnSrZyvnV2hrqTFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alix-earle-uses-this-drunk-elephant-d-bronzi-bronzer.html><span>←</span><span>Alix Earle Uses This Drunk Elephant D-Bronzi Bronzer</span></a>
