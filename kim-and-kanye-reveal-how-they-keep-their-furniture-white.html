I run around the house with towels. You do have to just take a deep breath and say, 'Ok, it’s going to happen. We decided to have lighter colors.'"</p><p>Kim recently did a phone interview with <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a>, revealing that life with three kids is the same no matter what end of the economic spectrum you’re at. Whether your family is rich or poor, kids will be kids, and that means your furniture is probably in for a rough couple of years.</p><p>However, Kim has a few tricks up her Yeezy sweater’s sleeves to prevent the worst of what manic children can do.</p><p>"Our last house that we just moved out of was all grays, which was a good test, because we knew we were going to move into a lighter house,” Kim says. “We have a great playroom and that’s where all the markers and the paints and the colors are and I really overdo it in the playroom so that by the time they’re done there they have no desire to take a pen on a nice piece of furniture."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SEE PARIS HILTON COSPLAY AS KIM KARDASHIAN</a></strong></p><p>That said, it was a learning experience for Kim, as she shares a story that most mothers know all too well - except the kid’s vanity part. "One time I walked in and my daughter had purple nail polish all over her little kid’s vanity, all over her toys, and all over the walls and I had just left the room for not even five minutes. It was at our last house so I might flip out now because Axel made our walls with this material that’s like not a Venetian plaster but some kind of plaster from Belgium. At the end of the day, you just have to take a deep breath and figure it out."</p><p>With little Chicago now a part of the Kardashian West clan, Kim also admits that the kid is getting her big brother and sister’s hand me downs. "I'm pretty much using the same crib and everything that I had for our other kids. We have a Vetro Lucite crib and we have a Royère bed in there and a really fluffy cream rug. We had a changing table made. I have a glider with an ottoman for feeding; With the first baby, I had a rocking chair, and I just love a glider so much more—you can move easier."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All this talk of furniture eventually leads Kim to admit that it’s her new passion. "I’m obsessed with decor these days. I feel like I’ve learned so much about architecture, about design, about furniture in the last, like, 2 years, and it’s like my passion right now. I love to look on 1stdibs for furniture."</p><p>Maybe we’ll see less topless photos and more shots of sofas on Kim’s Instagram?</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KENDALL JENNER STANDS BY BLAKE GRIFFIN AFTER HE WAS SPOTTED WITH ANOTHER WOMAN</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3ystcxmopqqlJbAqbXAp2SkmZ6usm7DxKyrZq%2BYnsGmecWuqaehpKq%2Fpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-canseco-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Canseco Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
