It might be hard to believe, but this network helped stars like <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> get going, and it was responsible for <a href=#>shows that changed the game</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To date, Even Stevens is one of the network's best shows. Beans is a classic character from the sitcom, and though he was <a href=#>nearly played by another star</a>, Steven Anthony Lawrence got the gig.</p><p>It's been some time since Lawrence had made a splash in the industry, so let's check in and see what the former Disney Channel star has been up to.</p><h2 id=39-even-stevens-39-was-a-classic-disney-channel-show>'Even Stevens' Was A Classic Disney Channel Show</h2><p>In the 2000s, the Disney Channel was red-hot with original offerings that became classic hits. Even Stevens remains not only one of the best shows of that era, but one of the network's best shows of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring Shia LaBeouf, Christy Carlson Romano, and a talented cast, Even Stevens was a hilarious family sitcom focused on the two younger children, as they navigated their way through life in Sacramento, California.</p><p>It didn't take long for the show to become a hit, and fans loved every second of it. It had no shortage of hilarious bits, quotable lines, and even some dope songs. Just ask most millennials, and they can tell you <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when we went to the moon</a>, and it's all thanks to Ren Stevens.</p><p>Eventually, the show reached its end after 3 seasons and 65 episodes. A short run, but it left a lasting legacy.</p><p>As we mentioned before, the show had a great cast, and this includes a young star who is recognizable to this very day.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Disney Channel Actors Who Are Still Friends With Their Co-Stars</a></span></p><h2 id=steven-anthony-lawrence-played-beans>Steven Anthony Lawrence Played Beans</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The young Steven Anthony Lawrence had earned some acting credits prior to landing his role on Even Stevens, which definitely helped him during that audition process. He even used a clever tactic too get the gig.</p><p>When opening up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vice</a>, the actor dished on how he landed the role on the show.</p><p>"I had a schtick when I was a kid: I would always tell a joke at the end of an audition," Lawrence said. "So, I told the Even Stevens producer a joke, and when I got the sides for the next callback, my joke was written in the script. I'm going, Oh God, I hope I get the part because it's going to be awkward if my joke's in here and I'm not," he said.</p><p>Though he was just a recurring character at first, Beans became more prominent on the show. To make it happen, Lawrence spent time with the folks behind the scenes in hope of improving his chances of sticking around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I would just get written into the next episode and the next episode. I'd kind of go and hang out with them so they knew who I was, and maybe, hopefully, get back into it," he said.</p><p>Beans ultimately left a lasting impression on fans of the show. Lawrence himself did not turn into a major performer like Shia LaBeaouf, but this doesn't mean that life has been boring since his Disney Channel days.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Disney Channel Stars Have Released The Most Albums?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-he-39-s-been-up-to>What He's Been Up To</h2><p>So, what in the world is Steven Andrew Lawrence up to since the show? Well, he's had his hands full.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He opened up to Vice about leaving the business behind. Though he had roles after Even Stevens, the declining health of family members left little time to audition, effectively icing his career.</p><p>"You're being a caregiver, you've got to be there to change diapers. And you can't do that when you're on auditions. That's physically impossible. It just wouldn't work," he said.</p><p>Lawrence did go viral years back after working with a mall Santa, but come to find out, this was more of a tribute to his father.</p><p>"Dad was really into Christmas. He was a big Clark Griswold guy. So, this was kind of my way to feel close to him during the holidays and do something cool for people," he revealed.</p><p>The former Disney Channel star also dished on wanting to open up an acting studio, stating that he's been giving youngsters virtual acting lessons.</p><p>Outside of this, Lawrence co-hosts a podcast on YouTube, and he also does work on Cameo, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Dove Cameron's Career Suggest A Darker Side Of The Disney Channel?</a></span></p><p>Steven Anthony Lawrence will always be remembered for playing Beans, and it would be great for him to achieve his dreams of opening up an acting studio to help develop the next generation of young stars.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Joey King's Career From Disney Channel To The Princess</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq7EmqWsZZanvK55xK%2Bcp2WjqbK3sc2sZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-downey-sr-dead-at-85-read-robert-downey-jr-s-tribute.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Downey Sr. Dead at 85: Read Robert Downey Jr.s Tribute</span></a>
