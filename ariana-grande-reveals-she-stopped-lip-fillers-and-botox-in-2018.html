Since then, the “Dangerous Woman” singer became a Grammy award winning musician with <a href=#>six studio albums</a>.</p><p>“Over the years, I used makeup as a disguise or something to hide behind with more and more hair and more thicker the eyeliner — that can be so beautiful at times and I still do have love for it and appreciation for it,” she said. “But I think as I get older, I don’t love that being the intention behind it anymore.”</p><p>Grande recently made headlines when she began dating Wicked costar <a href=#><strong>Ethan Slater</strong></a> after her <a href=#>separation</a> from estranged husband <a href=#><strong>Dalton Gomez</strong> </a>in July.

But these are just thoughts that I feel like we should be able to discuss if we are sitting here talking about beauty secrets.
