It featured a bralette top with delicate pleat detailing. Lila opted for a pair of black underwear to wear beneath the transparent dress. She topped the look off with a pair of black heels and silver earrings.</p><p>The model wore her straight blonde hair up in a chic bun with face-framing pieces, and kept her makeup simple and natural with a touch of black eyeliner and long lashes.</p><p>At an Elite Model Agency party in London in September 1993, Kate, <a href=#>now 49</a>, posed for photographers in a similar metallic sheer floor-length dress. She also wore a pair of distinct black underwear underneath the barely-there frock. Kate smiled for photographers while wearing no makeup at the glitzy event and her hair swept up in a casual bun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lila-Moss-Pays-Homage-to-Mom-Kate-Moss-With-Sheer-Slip-Dress-at-the-Fashion-Awards-in-London-05.jpg><p>The now iconic images of Kate wearing the see-through dress — which was designed by <strong>Liza Bruce</strong> — are easily recognized today by fashion fans around the globe.</p><p>The similarities between the two dresses are no coincidence. Lila enlisted the help of Albanian fashion designer <strong>Nensi Dojaka</strong> to create a modern-day rendition of the famous outfit.</p><p>“I love to feel elegant, chic and sexy, and Nensi’s designs are the perfect balance of all of these vibes, so I’m feeling confident,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Lila told Vogue</a> before the event. “It’s crossed at the back and has symmetrical sheer cut-outs on the sides that gives the illusion of a low, open back – in some ways, it reminds me of armor.”</p><p>Lila added that her mom’s dress wasn’t the only thing she drew inspiration from. “For the hair, I wanted something effortless – I found a reference on Pinterest of my mum with a wispy bun for a Donna Karan show in 1993,” she revealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lila-Moss-Pays-Homage-to-Mom-Kate-Moss-With-Sheer-Slip-Dress-at-the-Fashion-Awards-in-London-02.jpg><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Dojaka, 28, also opened up to Vogue about his thoughts behind the one-of-a-kind design.</p><p>“The inspiration for this look came from the iconic Liza Bruce sheer slip dress worn by Kate in 1993,” he told the publication. “Lila is the perfect example of a young woman unafraid to set her own rules – her confidence makes her embrace her sensuality, and she’s the ideal fit for the Nensi Dojaka woman who’s owning her femininity.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6G2ra2Mpqasq12dvK%2B70axkpqedYriiwMRmpKiro2LEqsDHZqqhnZWneqW%2BxKyqZpmkYsGpsYyfmKygmaS7bq3Wmqmdq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-everything-that-has-changed-since-the-duggar-show-started.html><span>←</span><span>Here's Everything That Has Changed Since The Duggar Show Started</span></a>
