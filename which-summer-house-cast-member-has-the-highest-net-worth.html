In addition to the drama our favorite women bring each week, there is another show that came in hot, 'Summer House'! Although the show appeared to be one worth tuning into, many Bravo<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> fans weren't sure if they'd watch the show</a>, however, it seems as if they are very thankful they did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show has gone on to become such a success, that 'Summer House' is coming back better than ever with its fifth season on February 4, 2021! While the show has at times, been compared to that of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Vanderpump Rules'</a>, the East Coast "version" brings more drama, romance, and a whole lot of partying. With the cast constantly evolving, viewers are beginning to wonder just how rich the cast is, and who the richest might be! Let's find out.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ranking The Vanderpump Rules Cast By Net Worth (From Stassi To Lisa)</a></span></p><h2 id=the-richest-summer-house-cast-member>The Richest 'Summer House' Cast Member</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Carl-Radke-Kyle-Cooke-Linsday-Hubbard-e1608258306423.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bravo knows what they are doing when it comes to reality television programming! With their success from shows such as 'The Real Housewives', 'Vanderpump Rules', and 'Below Deck', it was only fitting for the hit network to come out with more reality TV gold and they certainly delivered. 'Summer House' originally aired in 2017 and is currently set to air its fifth season come February 2021. While the original cast remains viewers' favorite, the newest castmates have definitely brought the heat, making for great additions to the show.</p><p>The group rents a home every summer in Montauk, New York, which is<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> currently on the market for $5 million</a>, where they escape the busy city every weekend to let loose and get into a lot of trouble! Considering the allure that comes with living in New York City and summer-ing in Montauk, fans are wondering just how wealthy the cast is and more specifically, who is the richest? Well, believe it or not, but the only original cast members left on the show, <span style=text-decoration:underline>Carl Radke, Kyle Cooke, and Lindsay Hubbard all come in with a net worth of $1.1 million!</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Things You Didn't Know About The Cast Of RHOSLC</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kyle-Cooke-Lindsay-Hubbard-Net-Worth-e1608258416471.jpg><p>Lindsay Hubbard is the owner of her very own PR company, Hubb House, where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is expected to earn nearly $200,000 annually</a>, which doesn't include her 'Summer House' salary. As for Carl Radke, he works in sales and development alongside Kyle Cooke, for their company, Loverboy Inc. It goes without saying that the trio does quite well for themselves outside of the show, but just how much are they racking in each season?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, while their salaries aren't disclosed, many fans believe that the three cast members are making anywhere between $10,000 - $20,000 per episode, which is on par with the cast of 'Vanderpump Rules'. With their salaries from Bravo and their real 9 to 5's, it is no surprise that Carl, Kyle, and Lindsay have all been able to amass a little over $1 million throughout their careers in business and reality television!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Bravo: 10 Of The Richest Bravolebrities</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXq0wcymnKtlmKTCtLGMnJisrF2isq6uxKtkoZmjYsGpsYyhoKCglajBbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-ascenstion-wrestlezone.html><span>←</span><span>the ascenstion - Wrestlezone</span></a>
