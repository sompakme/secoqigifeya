His son, <a href=#><strong>Robert Downey Jr.</strong></a>, confirmed the news on Wednesday, July 7.</p><p>“RIP Bob D. Sr. 1936-2021,” the <a href=#>Iron Man star</a>, 56, captioned a black-and-white photo of his father on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “Last night, dad passed peacefully in his sleep after years of enduring the ravages of Parkinson’s.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Robert-Downey-Sr-Dead-at-85-After-Parkinsons-Battle.jpg><p>In his tribute, the Avengers: Endgame actor not only applauded his dad’s career but also thanked his stepmother, <a href=#><strong>Rosemary Rogers</strong></a>, for her support through the years. “He was a true maverick filmmaker, and remained remarkably optimistic throughout,” he continued. “According to my stepmoms [sic] calculations, they were happily married for just over 2000 years. Rosemary Rogers-Downey, you are a saint, and our thoughts and prayers are with you.”</p><p>Robert Sr. and his first wife, Elsie Downey, welcomed daughter <a href=#><strong>Allyson Downey</strong></a> in 1963 and Robert Jr. in 1965. They divorced in 1975, and <a href=#>Elsie died in 2014</a>.</p><p>The Boogie Nights actor was married to Laura Ernst from 1991 until her death from Lou Gehrig’s disease in 1994. He then tied the knot with Rogers in 1998.</p><p>Robert Sr. was born Robert Elias Jr. in New York City in June 1936. He changed his last name to Downey — the same surname as his stepfather, James Downey — when he wanted to enlist in the Army but was underage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Robert-Downey-Sr-Dead-at-85-After-Parkinsons-Battle-Inline.jpg><p>The actor was critical to New York’s underground film movement in the 1960s. He wrote and directed the 1961 short Ball’s Bluff and became a breakout filmmaker with 1969’s Putney Swope, which he directed, wrote and produced. He then tackled bigger budget projects, including 1972’s Greaser’s Palace.</p><p>Amid his growing resume, Robert Sr. also appeared in To Live and Die in L.A., Boogie Nights, Magnolia, The Twilight Zone, Matlock, 1st & Ten, Hail Caesar and Tower Heist. The 2011 movie, which starred <a href=#><strong>Ben Stiller</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Eddie Murphy</strong></a>, was his final acting credit. His last directing project was the 2005 documentary Rittenhouse Square.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Robert Jr. and Allyson, now 57, made their film debuts in their father’s 1970 movie, Pound, when they were 5 and 7, respectively. The Sherlock Holmes star has appeared in eight films directed by his late dad — Pound, Greaser’s Palace, Hugo Pool, Moment to Moment, Up the Academy, Rented Lips, America and Too Much Sun — and acted in two movies alongside him — Hail Caesar and Johnny Be Good.</p><p>In addition to his wife and kids, Robert Sr. is survived by Robert Jr.’s three children: Indio, 27, whom he shares with ex-wife <strong>Deborah Falconer</strong>, and Exton, 9, and Avri, 6, whom he has with wife <a href=#><strong>Susan Downey</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5Kav7V5w6iup52pYsCzecOemJ1lkal6eYGMq5yanF2nvKOx0a1knaeno7K6ecmrZKxlpKe2o8HTnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peter-holt-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Peter Holt Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
