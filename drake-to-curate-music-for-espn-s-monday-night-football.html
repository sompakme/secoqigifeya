Drake's Certified Lover Boy: Who Scored The Highest Sales</a></p><p>Drake has a strong admiration for all things sports. Fun fact: he's even an ambassador for the Toronto Raptors, his hometown's National Basketball Association team. Just a few weeks ago, he announced the release date for&nbsp;Certified&nbsp;Lover Boy on ESPN's news program SportsCenter. So its only right that he'd take up this opportunity to share his music to all the sports fans that tune in to the network every week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With ESPN's subscription service seeing a 75% increase within the last year, they're certainly looking to keep the momentum going strong. As the prominent sports channel has had successes from bringing in some of the biggest names of the music industry, like Diplo and DJ Khaled, it's only right that they passed the aux cord to the man with the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most number-one songs</a> on Billboard’s R&B/Hip-Hop Chart.</p><p>"Now we are here… the kickoff of the football season. And who better to curate music for Monday Night Football than Drake who sits firmly at the intersection of music and sports," the network's Vice President of Sports Marketing, Emeka Ofodile, expresses in the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement</a>, "We couldn’t be more excited for this upcoming collaboration."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the announcement, Drake will be picking music selections that "encapsulates both the energy and mood of select Monday Night Games." His <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">selections will also appear</a> in pre-games and promotional spots for the entirety of the season. The songs are said to include selections from Certified Lover Boy, some tracks from his past discography, and a few songs from other artists of his choice.</p><p>While any compensation the rapper will receive for his contribution has yet to be disclosed, it goes without saying that the new Walt Disney-owned network is probably fetching him a pretty big paycheck.</p><p><span class=related-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Drake Rents Out Dodger Stadium For Dinner Date With Johanna Leia</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN Press room</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxs63KnmStp12YwrOt055kpq2jnrBuss6rZJ6roKPAbrnOp5uasV2jtqi002adqKekl66tuI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alicepalay-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Alicepalay Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
