Despite widespread criticism about their 15-year age gap, the two remained blissfully in love for years, seemingly intent on defying all the skeptics.</p><p>So, when the two abruptly split after six years, with r<strong>umors abounding that Kutcher had been unfaithful,</strong> fans were shocked. But the divorce was just the tip of the iceberg. As it turned out, Moore’s intense devotion to Kutcher had driven a massive wedge between her and her kids, sparking years of estrangement post-split.</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a look at <strong>Demi Moore’s addictive relationship with Ashton Kutcher</strong> and its devastating impact on her relationships with her three kids.</p><h2 id=demi-moore-rsquo-s-addictive-relationship-with-ashton-kutcher-took-a-toll-on-her-relationships-with-her-kids>Demi Moore’s Addictive Relationship With Ashton Kutcher Took A Toll On Her Relationships With Her Kids</h2><p>After two years of dating and a stunning private ceremony in Beverly Hills, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher appeared poised to build a picture-perfect marriage. However, as Moore later revealed in her 2019 memoir, 'Inside Out', reality fell short of expectations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>For one, <strong>Moore's devotion to Kutcher ended up eclipsing everything else in her life</strong>, including her relationships with her three daughters; Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah Willis.</p><p>“I went into contortions to try to fit the mold of the woman he wanted his wife to be. I put him first. He didn’t ask me to do that. It’s just what I did—what I’d learned to do from my mother, and her mother before her. I wanted this marriage to work, and I was willing to do whatever it took, to jump through any hoop.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-13t130056-360.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Demi Moore Fooled Fans Using A Double During A Pregnant Gymnastics Stunt With David Letterman">Demi Moore Fooled Fans Using A Double During A Pregnant Gymnastics Stunt With David Letterman</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Demi Moore pulled off quite the stunt during a memorable appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman.</p><p>Predictably, Moore's intense devotion to Kutcher drove a deep wedge between her and her children. In a 2019 interview on Red Table Talk, Tallulah Willis, the only one of the Ghost star's children still residing with her at the time, admitted that <strong>Moore and Kutcher’s dynamic gradually damaged her relationship with her mom</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Watching the behavior with Ashton, those years, because everyone had left the house and it was just me living there. I felt very forgotten, and I feel like I developed and nurtured a narrative where she didn’t love me and I truly believed it. I know that she does [love me], one hundred percent, but in that moment, you're hurt, and you can't fathom that someone that loves you would do that to you, and would choose others more than you."</p><h2 id=demi-moore-rsquo-s-daughters-cut-ties-with-her-after-her-divorce-from-ashton-kutcher>Demi Moore’s Daughters Cut Ties With Her After Her Divorce From Ashton Kutcher</h2><p>Demi Moore's relationships with her kids continued on a downward spiral throughout her six-year marriage to Ashton Kutcher. Matters came to a head when Tallulah was arrested for underage drinking shortly after her seventeenth birthday. In the aftermath, <strong>both Tallulah and her older sister, Scout, chose to sever ties with their mother</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/demi-moore-and-her-kids-at-96th-academy-awards-vanity-fair-party.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moore’s sole consolation was her eldest daughter Rumer, with whom she formed a tight bond in the wake of her divorce from Kutcher. However, their relationship suffered a brutal blow when Moore suffered convulsions from inhaling nitrous and smoking synthetic marijuana while hosting a party in her Los Angeles home.</p><p>“I scared Rumer so badly when she saw me there, semiconscious on the floor; she thought I might die in front of her. She was completely freaked out, and after that night she joined her younger sisters in refusing to speak to me.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/is-bruce-willis-s-wife-emma-heming-close-with-the-kids-he-shares-with-ex-demi-moore_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Is Bruce Willis’s Wife Emma Heming Close With The Kids He Shares With Ex Demi Moore?">Is Bruce Willis’s Wife Emma Heming Close With The Kids He Shares With Ex Demi Moore?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Bruce Willis has a big family including ex-wife Demi Moore and their many daughters, and his wife Emma Heming has an interesting dynamic with them.</p><p>Subsequently, Moore began to understand just how deeply <strong>her flawed dynamic with Kutcher had damaged her relationships with her kids</strong>.</p><p>“I think the part that was real was that the girls were angry I’d become so dependent on Ashton—I was addicted to him, is the best way I can put it. And I did all the things that addicts do. I prioritized my addiction over my needs and the needs of my family. I made strange, unconvincing justifications for my behavior—and his. I had held the family together as a pillar, and the pillar was crumbling.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=demi-moore-was-estranged-from-her-kids-for-years-after-her-divorce-from-ashton-kutcher>Demi Moore Was Estranged From Her Kids For Years After Her Divorce From Ashton Kutcher</h2><p>Even as her <a href=#>divorce from Kutcher pushed her into a life-threatening downward spiral</a>, Moore found little solace or support from her kids.</p><p>“I felt villainized by my family. I was angry that my girls weren’t showing me any compassion and that Bruce refused to intercede,” she shared in her 2019 memoir.</p><p>“They all wanted me to go to rehab, which just seemed nuts to me: I’m going to show up at rehab and say, “My name is Demi and I don’t drink and once I did a whip-it”? I knew that the real problem wasn’t drugs or alcohol.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/scout-willis-tallulah-willis-rumer-willis-at-the-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-premiere.jpg><p>Despite her initial reservations, <strong>Moore eventually caved and entered rehab</strong>.

I told them how important it was for them to attend family week—not just for me, but for all of us. But they refused. After I completed the program, I reached out repeatedly, offering to meet wherever it would be comfortable—with a therapist, whatever. I was rebuffed or ignored.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/demi-moore-and-kevin-costner.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Demi Moore’s New Project Allegedly Made Kevin Costner Cut Ties After Years Of Friendship">Demi Moore’s New Project Allegedly Made Kevin Costner Cut Ties After Years Of Friendship</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kevin warned Demi not to work with this 'Yellowstone' producer, but she offended him by going against his advice.</p><p>Though the Ghost star and her kids have since patched things up, <strong>Moore had to endure years of physical and emotional turmoil without her family's support</strong>.</p><p>“That feeling of not being anchored by all of these people’s needs and my role as their nurturer was unbearable.
