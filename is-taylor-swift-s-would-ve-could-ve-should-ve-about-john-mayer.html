Fans dove headfirst into decoding the lyrics on <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>‘s Midnights — and some are convinced she <a href=#>penned a scathing track</a> about ex <a href=#><strong>John Mayer</strong></a>.</p><p>The Grammy winner, 32, <a href=#>dropped her 10th studio album</a> on Friday, October 21, initially releasing 13 new songs. Hours after the record became available to stream, Swift gave listeners <a href=#>seven bonus tracks</a> on Midnights (3am Edition), including “Glitch” and “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve.” It didn’t take fans long to theorize that the latter <a href=#>explored Swift’s messy history</a> with Mayer, 45, to whom she was linked in 2009.</p><p>“And I damn sure would’ve never danced with the devil / At 19, and the God’s honest truth is that the pain was heaven / And now that I’m grown, I’m scared of ghosts,” the Cats actress sings. “Memories feel like weapons / And now that I know, I wish you left me wondering.”</p><p>As the song continues, Swift hints, “I regret you all the time,” but even more telling lyrics appear toward the end.</p><p>“If clarity’s in death, then why won’t this die? / Years of tearing down our banners, you and I / Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts / Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first,” she sings.</p><p>The pop star and the Connecticut native <a href=#>collaborated on “Half of My Heart,”</a> which was featured on Mayer’s 2009 record, Battle Studies. The songwriters were romantically linked soon after, but their <a href=#>whirlwind relationship</a> quickly turned sour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Why-Fans-Think-Taylor-Swifts-Midnights-Bonus-Track-About-John-Mayer.jpg><p>Swift was 19 when she was rumored to be dating Mayer, who was 32 at the time. In 2010, the Amsterdam actress penned the now-iconic <a href=#>breakup anthem</a> “Dear John,” which <a href=#>called out an ex’s “dark twisted games”</a> and asked, “Don’t you think 19 is too young?”</p><p>When <a href=#>Midnights</a> dropped on Friday, fans were quick to connect the alleged dots. “Something tells me john mayer just jumped out of his sleep with a gasp. I know he felt a shift,” one Twitter user <a href=#>wrote</a>, while another <a href=#>joked</a> that the new lyrics made “Dear John” sound “like the nicest, gentlest song of all time.”</p><p>A <a href=#>third fan</a> uncovered what seemed like one of <a href=#>Swift’s trademark Easter eggs</a>, writing, “Taylor really put Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve, a song directly about her relationship with John Mayer when she was just 19, as TRACK 19 ON THE ALBUM. SHOTS WERE FIRED.”</p><p>The “Ivy” artist hasn’t directly addressed her past with Mayer, but the “Gravity” crooner opened up about <a href=#>being the subject of Swift’s lyrics</a> during a 2012 Rolling Stone interview. At the time, Mayer said he was “humiliated” by “Dear John,” calling the ballad “cheap.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Nearly 10 years later, the “Heartbreak Warfare” singer <a href=#>replied to an angry DM from a Swift fan</a>, which he later shared via TikTok. “F–k yourself you ugly bitch I hope you choke on something,” the user wrote in November 2021, to which Mayer replied, “I’ve been getting so many messages like these the past couple days. I’m not upset, I just tend to have a curious mind and feel compelled to ask. Do you really hope that I die?”</p><p>After the fan apologized, Mayer added, “So it’s a fun thing people are doing without taking into account that I might see it and be affected by it? It’s 100 percent OK. Go forth and live happy and healthy!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCsZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqcBuw86uo52ulWKwsMHLna2eZaOdvLa4w6%2BcZpmSpMK1ecmon6dlnZbGpr6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diego-velazquez-actor-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-family-career.html><span>←</span><span>Diego Velazquez (Actor) Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Family, Career,</span></a>
