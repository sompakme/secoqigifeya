Since its inception, the show has had more than one-hundred and fifty cast members, many of whom have gone on to become major stars of film and television.&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;launched the careers of&nbsp;<strong>Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Chris Rock, Will Ferrell, Maya Rudolph, Tina Fey</strong> and many, many more big-name stars. <a href=#>While critics and fans alike often complain about the declining quality of Saturday Night Live,</a><i>&nbsp;</i>it's undeniable that the show&nbsp;is an excellent jumping-off point for young actors and comedians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Actress Went From Being Rejected For "Not Being Attractive," To Turning Down 'SNL'</a></span></p><p>Bowen Yang is one such young comedian. He&nbsp;has been a featured player on&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;since the start of the forty-fifth season in 2020, and it is all but certain that he will return next season as a repertory player. Yang is one of&nbsp;Saturday Night Live's brightest young stars, and as such, his&nbsp;is a name that all comedy fans should know. Here are ten things to know about Bowen Yang.</p><h2 id=he-started-out-as-a-writer-on-snl><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Started Out As a Writer On 'SNL'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bowen Yang joined the cast of Saturday Night Live during the forty-fifth season, but he actually joined the writing staff of the show a year earlier. He is one of many SNL writers who later became cast members, including Jason Sudeikis, Michael Che, and Andrew Dismukes. Some of his sketches from the forty-third&nbsp;season include “The Actress” starring Emma Stone, and “Cheques” starring Sandra Oh.</p><h2 id=he-co-wrote-that-harry-styles-sketch-you-know-the-one><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Co-Wrote That Harry Styles Sketch – You Know The One</span></h2><p>While Bowen Yang spent a year as a full-time writer on Saturday Night Live, his most well-known sketch actually came the following year when he was pulling double duty as&nbsp;a writer and a cast member. The sketch was called “Sara Lee,” and it featured host Harry Styles as a gay social media intern who makes personal and often graphic posts on the official Sara Lee Bread Instagram account. The sketch was a brand new kind of humor for SNL, and <a href=#>Yang admitted that he couldn’t believe it was actually put on TV</a>. The sketch went majorly viral, and even spawned a sequel starring Daniel Kaluuya the following season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bowen-yang-is-making-saturday-night-live-history><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bowen Yang Is Making 'Saturday Night Live' History</span></h2><p>The "Sara Lee" sketch was noteworthy for featuring an explicitly gay main character and undeniably queer themes without making queerness the butt&nbsp;of the joke.&nbsp;Bowen Yang is actually just the third openly gay male cast member in SNL&nbsp;history, and the first to&nbsp;last longer than one season on the show. And that's not the only way that Yang is making&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;history. He's also the first-ever Chinese American to be a main cast member on the show, and just the fourth-ever cast member of Asian descent.&nbsp;In 2021, he made further SNL history when <a href=#>he was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series at the Emmy Awards</a>. He is the first featured player to ever be nominated as an actor on SNL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-has-already-been-nominated-for-two-emmy-awards><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Has Already Been Nominated For Two Emmy Awards</span></h2><p>In addition to his Emmy Award nomination this year in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category, Bowen Yang was also nominated for an Emmy Award two years ago, back when he was a writer on SNL.&nbsp;Accordingly, his nomination that year came&nbsp;in the Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series category.</p><p>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Think Pete Davidson Could Be Leaving ‘SNL’</a></p><h2 id=in-only-two-seasons-he-s-already-created-several-memorable-snl-characters><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>In Only Two Seasons, He's Already Created Several Memorable SNL Characters</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No article about&nbsp;an SNL&nbsp;actor would be complete without an overview of some of their most famous characters. Bowen Yang's most well-known recurring character is Chen Biao, a Chinese government&nbsp;minister who frequently stops by the Weekend Update desk to discuss U.S.-China relations. Another Bowen Yang character to know is "The Iceberg That Sank The&nbsp;Titanic." The character has only appeared on&nbsp;Weekend Update&nbsp;once so far, but it was so popular that&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;fans will almost surely see him again next season.</p><h2 id=he-has-also-done-plenty-of-celebrity-impressions><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>&nbsp;He Has Also Done Plenty Of Celebrity&nbsp;Impressions</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bowen Yang is not known for his impressions, but anyone who acts on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;will have to pull out some eventually. Many of Yang's impressions on the show have been of other well-known Asian-Americans, like presidential candidate Andrew Yang and comedian Ken Jeong. However, he's also done some more unexpected ones, such&nbsp;as his&nbsp;impression of American writer Fran Lebowitz (<a href=#>which Lebowitz herself did not care for</a>).</p><h2 id=he-s-a-writer-for-schmigadoon-as-well><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He's A Writer For 'Schmigadoon!' As Well</span></h2><p>While&nbsp;Saturday Night Live&nbsp;was the first major television show that Bowen Yang wrote for, it is not the only one. He is also credited as a writer for the new&nbsp;Apple TV+ original series&nbsp;Schmigadoon!&nbsp;starring Keegan-Michael Key and Cecily Strong (Yang's&nbsp;SNL co-star). Key and Strong star as a couple who accidentally find themselves trapped in the world of a Golden Age musical. Bowen Yang is credited as the co-writer of the show's third episode, "Cross That Bridge."&nbsp;Schmigadoon!&nbsp;is executive-produced by&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;creator and showrunner Lorne Michaels, so it makes sense that Yang was asked to join the writing staff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=saturday-night-live-is-not-the-only-show-bowen-yang-has-appeared-on><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>'Saturday Night Live' Is Not The Only Show Bowen Yang&nbsp;Has Appeared On</span></h2><p>Bowen Yang is most widely recognized for the many characters and impressions he has performed on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live,&nbsp;but&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;is far from the only show that he has acted on. He plays a significant supporting role on&nbsp;the Comedy Central series&nbsp;Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens,&nbsp;and he has guest starred on several other popular TV comedies, such as&nbsp;Broad City&nbsp;and&nbsp;Girls5Eva.&nbsp;He also plays a lead role in the Audible original podcast series&nbsp;Hot White Heist.</p><p>Related: <a href=#>Original 'SNL' Cast Members Were Paid Less Than $800 Per Week</a></p><h2 id=he-hosts-a-podcast-called-las-culturistas><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Hosts A Podcast Called 'Las Culturistas'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his work as a writer and an actor, Bowen Yang is also quite the successful podcaster. He hosts his podcast "Las Culturistas" with his longtime friend Matt Rogers, and the two have been hosting the podcast since 2016. It has grown in popularity immensely over the years, and it is now produced by Will Ferrell's podcast network in conjunction with iHeart Radio.</p><h2 id=bowen-yang-is-just-getting-started><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bowen Yang Is Just Getting Started</span></h2><p>According to his page on IMDB, Bowen Yang will be voicing characters in two major upcoming movies:&nbsp;The Tiger's Apprentice,&nbsp;starring Henry Golding and Sandra Oh, and&nbsp;The Monkey King,&nbsp;starring BD Wong and Jimmy O. Yang. Bowen Yang will also continue to star on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live,&nbsp;where he will presumably continue to get more and more screen time. It is very likely that he has more TV and film roles, writing jobs, and&nbsp;Emmy Award nominations in his future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Next: <a href=#>Fans Think The Best Athlete To Ever Host 'SNL' Isn't Even Debatable</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurs6wnKdlqZa7qHmQaWStoJmjtLR506hkpKafrHqirs6uq2asmJp6urvUp55mq56herTAwKtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-was-brewstew-michael-death-cause-what-happened-to-him.html><span>←</span><span>What Was Brewstew Michael Death Cause?
