As we close in on the 25th anniversary of “The Showcase Of The Immortals,” Mosh and Blade asked Bob to reflect on his induction into the WWE Hall Of Fame. Bob said that “it was nice to be appreciated” by those within the WWE and his fans around the globe, and that the HOF induction was “fantastic” and a true honor.</p><p>As many fans of “Your Home Of Wrestling Radio” remember, Bob’s long-time colleague and fellow member of the ’05 WWE Hall Of Fame class, “Mr. Wonderful” Paul Orndorff, joined Monday Night Mayhem over two years ago, and went on the record and voiced his displeasure of only receiving a plaque at the time. Since then, of course, members of the HOF have received commemorative rings by the WWE. Jokingly, Bob added that if Paul was one of the “Seven Dwarfs,” he would be “Grumpy.”</p><p>The MNM Crew discussed the strong possibilities of seeing Bob’s son, “The Legend Killer” Randy Orton go one-on-one against John Cena, and the possibilities of re-christening their feud into the new year of 2009. Before that happens, the MWF audience will be seeing Bob in the same building as “Johnny Fabulous” himself, John Cena, Sr. this weekend! Bob said that both John and Randy are “two of the best out there today,” and then issued a challenge to John Sr., exclusively on the airwaves of The Mayhem! Tension is mounting fans between both families, and the only way to hear the challenge being laid out to the Cena family is by tuning in to the airwaves of Monday Night Mayhem!</p><p>Based on the success that John Cena has received from movies and other forms of entertainment outside of the ring, Blade asked “Cowboy” Bob if he knows if Randy has been approached to do the same and/or if that is in his future. Bob put over Cena’s work in “The Marine,” and replied by saying that it could be possible, simply because the business has been expanding and many connections have been made between wrestling and other industries.</p><p>The WWE Survivor Series is one week away from this Sunday night, and it is now confirmed that Team Orton will go head-to-head against Team Batista Mosh asked Bob about having any interest to be a part of his son’s team in any way…if the “call” was made. Bob joked around about the guys being much younger than him, but mentioned that he would not be against being a manager.</p><p>The MNM Crew discussed the recent “bans” of the term “wrestlers,” “sports-entertainers,” and many other similar phrases by the WWE, and asked Bob if he was offended by that, being one of the pioneers of professional wrestling in the ’70’s and ’80’s. Until being on The Mayhem, Bob was unaware of this, and said that the fans should call the wrestlers what they feel like, as what they do in the ring speaks for itself.</p><p>There have been many harsh remarks and negative comments over the years against Bob’s son, Randy. Mosh and Blade asked Bob if he thinks that fatherhood and being a “family man” has changed his son’s life. Bob said that Randy is indeed very happy with his new family (his wife and new daughter), and when he is performing for the WWE, his attitude is “all business.” At home, he is “all family.”</p><p>“The Road To Wrestlemania” has begun, and as those around the world begin to count down the days until the WWE invades Reliant Stadium in Houston, Tex., Mosh asked Bob if his WM appearances were the most-defining moments in his career. Bob candidly replied that all three have different and personal meanings to him, and that all three were historic in their own ways. He, like all of the WWE Universe, is looking forward to WrestleMania XXV.</p><p>Mosh brought The Mayhem Nation back to the year 2005, and the feud that occurred between the Orton father and son team vs. The Undertaker — climaxing at the No Mercy Handicap Casket Match. Were the internet rumors true about the reported “heat” between “Cowboy” Bob and “The Phenom?” Bob went on record saying he has not talked with Taker in a few years and had great matches with him, so he does not know of any heat between the two. Bob continued on by saying that it was fantastic having the opportunity to team with his son, and is proud of the fact that he is a part of a select few father/son combos in professional wrestling history.</p><p>The business has seen consistent evolutions over the years, and The Mayhem’s listening audience wished to know where Bob sees the future of wrestling headed. “Ace” replied with some very interesting comments to this question. “As long as the guys go out and work real hard to entertain the fans and give it everything they got, everything will be fine.”</p><p>In closing, Mosh and Blade asked the ultimate “fantasy warfare” question that fans have asked for years: Who would win between “The Legend Killer” Randy Orton and “Cowboy” Bob Orton in their primes (w/Randy now and “Cowboy” Bob in the mid ’80’s)? Bob said he “would have given it a pretty good go,” but the guys are getting faster and stronger these days, so he probably would not be able to keep up with some of today’s superstars.</p><p>More “Cowboy” Bob goodness is contained in this 30+ minute MNM exclusive interview, including Bob’s thoughts and comments on whether or not we have seen the last of Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair inside the squared circle, his memories of traveling and performing with The Iron Sheik<br>(and if he thinks his persona is “an act”), and whether or not his arm has fully healed from the cast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfo9pa2ttXZe8o3nOq6uopl2ovaatyqxkqKZdnbKiwIywoK2gXamurLHRZpqhmZyhsq%2BzxKxko6eYo3qksc2aZKyq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alyssa-navarro.html><span>←</span><span>Alyssa Navarro</span></a>
