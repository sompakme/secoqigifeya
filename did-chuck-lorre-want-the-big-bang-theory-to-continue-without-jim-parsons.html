Parsons' decision to leave ended the sitcom, and some of the cast had quite the reaction, including Kaley Cuoco.</p><p>Chuck Lorre also had his own perspective, the showrunner was open to continuing things but ultimately, he knew it might've been best to call it a day.</p><h2 id=jim-parsons-decision-to-leave-the-big-bang-theory-ended-the-show>Jim Parsons' Decision To Leave The Big Bang Theory Ended The Show</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Signing a two-year deal for season 11 and 12, Jim Parsons had a feeling this would be his final contract on The Big Bang Theory. We can't say the same for the rest of the cast, with most, prepared to extend for a 13th season.</p><p>Parsons admitted that his decision to walk away didn't have anything to do with the show or its future. He came to terms, <a href=#>due to fatigue and the health of his dog at the time.</a></p><p><a href=#>Parsons</a> said alongside TV Guide, "Our final contract was for the last two years, but no one knew when we signed it what that would mean. I kind of had a suspicion in my heart that that was going to be it for me when I did sign that contract, but you never say never and who knows."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Unlike Others On The Show, Simon Helberg Was Ready For The Big Bang Theory To End</a></span></p><p>He continued, "I was exhausted, and I was really upset about, more than anything, one of our dogs was getting really at the end of his life around then."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a major decision and one that caught a lot of the cast off-guard, including Kaley Cuoco.</p><h2 id=kaley-cuoco-was-shocked-by-jim-parsons-choice-to-leave-the-show>Kaley Cuoco Was Shocked By Jim Parsons' Choice To Leave The Show</h2><p>Ending such a show is never easy, and then factor in the bond of the cast, it made things that much harder. Kaley Cuoco in particular was ready for a season 13. <a href=#>She really didn't envision ending the show at that point.</a></p><p>During a meeting, Jim Parsons stated that he was done and this completely blindsided Cuoco. She recalls the experience alongside Variety, “Jim said, ‘I don’t think I can continue on.’ And I was so shocked that I was literally like, ‘Continue on with what?’ Like, I didn’t even know what he was talking about. I looked at Chuck: ‘Wow. I thought we were — I’m so blown away right now.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Why Did Raj Wear So Many Layers On The Big Bang Theory?</a></span></p><p>The cast was a united one, making it clear that they all entered together, and would leave at the same time as well. Cuoco admitted that the decision became a bit easier to process during the final season, however, it still wasn't easy, especially during the final table ready for the finale.</p><p>Given the success of the sitcom, fans always wonder if there was a plan in place to possibly continue on without Parsons. Other shows have used this formula in the past. Speaking alongside The Hollywood Reporter,<a href=#>Lorre did admit this was considered.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chuck-lorre-thought-about-continuing-on-without-jim-parsons>Chuck Lorre Thought About Continuing On Without Jim Parsons</h2><p>Deep down, everyone involved knew it was time to end the show following Parsons' decision. However, Lorre did tinker with the idea of continuing on, if that's what everyone wanted.</p><p>"It’s the tank in Tiananmen Square. I’m not the guy to stand in front of it. Proceed. If they wanted to keep going, I would’ve said “God bless.” It’s hundreds of people that are making a living on this show. You don’t want to stop that," he told THR.</p><p>Lorre continued, "Considering the extraordinary success and the economic nature, I didn’t want to step in front of it. It gets bigger than you and you’ve just got to get out of the way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From his own personal perspective, Lorre did not want to continue on, especially given his history on shows that followed that formula.</p><p>"Long ago decided that I didn’t want to do a series if any of the principal players were not in it. I didn’t want to explain away the absence of a major character. I didn’t want to do Archie’s Place. You don’t just pull it apart and put it back together again and expect the same results."</p><p>Most fans can agree the correct decision was taken up by the cast and those behind the scenes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmLW2r8pmo6iqopp6uK3NrWStoJVir6qzjJuYp59dqbWmu9GyZK2nXZi8r8DIp6yeZaeewam71K1ko6GdYr2ivtKopaxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-threw-they-pu-y-after-sex-toy-is-thrown.html><span>←</span><span>&amp;quot;Who Threw They Pu**y?&amp;quot; After Sex Toy Is Thrown</span></a>
