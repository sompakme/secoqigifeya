Quotes from these stuck-up celebrities are often so ridiculous that they’re truly comical. Like, did you know Will Smith has called himself the best actor in the business? Or that Jennifer Lopez sometimes won’t even speak to the help, because she perceives herself to be above them? Some of the words and actions of these famous individuals are just flat out odd, and leave us shaking our heads with a laugh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you think carefully about it, some people are seemingly born thinking they are a gift to the world. So, take those conceited personalities, give them mega-stardom, and imagine just how cocky they become. While Hollywood is full of humble stars, it’s also filled to the brim with many who are about as arrogant as they come. This questionable personality trait becomes obvious following reports from those who have worked with them (or even sometimes, simply encountered them) and from the way they speak in interviews and on social media. Some even snub other celebrities who they think they’re too good to interact with. And vanity throughout Hollywood — that in itself would be a list of at least 1,000 names.</p><p>But from where we’re sitting — not having to directly deal with these people in person — cockiness in Hollywood is something entertaining to hear about. Here are 12 examples of celebrities that are just plainly far too cocky for their own good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-jay-z---too-good-for-de-niro><strong>12. Jay-Z - Too Good For De Niro</strong></h2><p>If you’re a famous rapper making millions and millions of dollars, and you are married to the beautiful <a href=#>Beyonce</a>, you’re bound to be a tad cocky. But, it seems <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>&nbsp;takes this liberty and runs with it. He takes cockiness to a whole other level.</p><p>He’s said a ton of stuck-up things in his day, including this commentary when he was addressing his accused lack of social responsibility: “I’m offended by that because, first of all, and this is gonna sound arrogant, but my presence is charity, just who I am, just like <a href=#>Obama</a>’s is. Obama provides hope, whether he does anything, the hope that he provides for a nation, and outside of America, is enough.” Hmm. Interesting take on that, Jay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jay-Z also went as far as to diss famed actor <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a>, who is apparently a big fan of his music. According to reports, the actor called Jay-Z six times and received a grand total of zero calls back. De Niro then verbally confronted Jay-Z about the situation, saying, “It doesn’t matter who you are. If someone calls you six times, you call them back. It doesn’t matter who you are. That is just rude.”</p><p></p><h2 id=11-gwyneth-paltrow---regular-moms-don-t-work-as-hard-as-me><strong>11. Gwyneth Paltrow - Regular Moms Don't Work As Hard As Me</strong></h2><p>Women hate <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, and here’s why: she is arguably obsessed with herself and her lifestyle, and she can’t help but let us know how she’s better than us for it. She once made angry an entire population of working mothers when she said, “when you're shooting a movie, they're like, ‘we need you to go to Wisconsin for two weeks,’ and then you work 14 hours a day and that part of it is very difficult. I think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as, of course there are challenges, but it's not like being on set.”</p><p>She’s also publically gone after the acting caliber of her colleagues, again showing she believes she’s above everyone else. She once said, “why is [<a href=#>Reese Witherspoon]</a> doing these stupid romantic comedies? ... But of course, it’s for money and status!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=10-jonah-hill---more-conceited-than-funny><strong>10. Jonah Hill - More Conceited Than Funny</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jonah Hill </a>— he’s so chubby and funny, yet apparently is also a completely conceited jerk. His face makes him look so kind, but many who know him personally beg to differ.</p><p>He once told Rolling Stone, “I’ve done one of the biggest challenges you could do in Hollywood, which is transition from being a comedic actor, to being a serious actor, and I’m really prideful of that. I could have made a billion dollars doing every big comedy of the last 10 years and didn’t in order to form a whole other life for myself. Now I have fulfillment doing both.”</p><p></p><h2 id=9-lady-gaga---i-was-born-a-star><strong>9. Lady Gaga - "I Was Born A Star"</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> has said about herself, “some people are just born stars, you either have it or you haven’t, and I was definitely born one.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many would agree Lady Gaga is extremely talented in not only singing, but acting as well, it wouldn’t hurt her to be a bit more&nbsp;humble. She is allegedly very kind to fans, but bossy to those around her, including assistants and stage help. And, her conceited quotes are plentiful. She also once said, “even as a kid I always had eyes on me, like bees on honey. I was always outrageous and I was always very smart.” Nothing like truly appreciating yourself.</p><p>While during the beginning of her career Lady Gaga was known to cover her face in public — presumably insecure about her appearance — things have clearly come very far since then.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-nicki-minaj---the-big-ego><strong>8. Nicki Minaj - The Big Ego</strong></h2><p>If you’ve ever heard <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> give an interview of any sort, you wouldn’t be surprised to learn that she’s one of the most arrogant musicians out there.</p><p>When she was a judge on American Idol, apparently she was consistently late to tapings and was reportedly blatantly rude to contestants and their families/friends, in addition to having an on-going quarrel with fellow judge (and diva), <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>. Carey even said of her time working with Minaj, “it was like going to work every day in Hell with Satan.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What was the cause of her chronic attitude? Thinking she was better than everyone else. In fact, she is so confident in herself that she took to Twitter this past summer to blast MTV for not nominating her for “Best Music Video” this year. How dare they? It ultimately sparked a teeny feud with <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, though it was quickly brushed under the rug.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-will-smith---the-best-actor-in-the-biz-so-he-thinks><strong>7. Will Smith - The Best Actor In The Biz, So He Thinks</strong></h2><p>Don’t let <a href=#>Will Smith</a>’s kind and cool composure fool you — according to reports throughout Hollywood, Smith is actually incredibly full of himself. He’s even gone as far as to call himself the best actor in the business.</p><p>One of his former long-time co-stars attested to this a few years ago. The first Vivian Banks of The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, actress Janet Huber, gave an interview in 2011 where she expressed her opinions about Smith. She said in reference to the popular television series, “there will never be a reunion, as I will never do anything with an as*hole like Will Smith. He is an egomaniac and has not grown up.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What’s more, Smith has also raised some incredibly arrogant children. His son <a href=#>Jaden</a>, for instance, is known to take to Twitter with outrageous and nonsensical commentary. And, when he gives interviews, it’s bound to make anyone cringe. Like when he told a reporter that he doesn’t see the need for taking driver’s ed, since people get into accidents even after taking it. Above the law, we see.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-jennifer-lopez---a-diva-in-the-air><strong>6. Jennifer Lopez -&nbsp;A Diva In The Air</strong></h2><p>Another arrogant American Idol judge is none other than <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a>. There are so many reports of J-Lo being downright arrogant, including her actions and the way she treats everyone from fans to assistants to co-workers. According to reports, J-Lo acts as if she’s above everyone else around her, even sometimes refusing to talk to certain people, such as waiters and sales people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she usually protests flying anything but private jet, there is one report of a flight attendant on a commercial airline who asked J-Lo what she wanted to drink, and — rather than telling the attendant — she turned to her assistant to have them relay the drink order. She simply isn’t interested in talking to anyone who isn’t at her level of fame, it appears.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-sean-p-diddy-combs---getting-sex-is-too-easy><strong>5. Sean “P. Diddy” Combs - Getting Sex Is Too Easy</strong></h2><p>Though <a href=#>Sean “P. Diddy” Combs</a>&nbsp;seems to be in the public eye a little less over the past few years, there was a long, long span of time when he was seemingly everywhere — from the music scene to television and the fashion world. And, everywhere he went, he left his mark. The rapper has said some of the cockiest things ever, including this comment on his apparently zealous sex life: “Bbng an international rap superstar… sex is one of the easiest things to get, so there is a point where you get tired of it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He felt extremely confident about his dive into the fashion world as well. At the launch of his clothing line he told reporters assertively, “I am fashion.” Sounds a lot like another famous rapper we know. But, we’ll get to that.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-justin-bieber---don-t-say-i-m-not-talented><strong>4. Justin Bieber - "Don't Say I'm Not Talented"</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Justin Bieber </a>— oh, where to begin. In the beginning of his career as a young teen, Bieber seemed to be extremely humble and kind. But, as his fame grew, so did his attitude. He took his apparent belief that he is one-of-a-kind way beyond his position in the music industry. As he gained more fans, he began making his rounds through women in a very public manner. But, that wasn’t the least of it. Outside of visits to brothels, he also thought himself above the law on several occasions, and boy was he wrong. He’s been in trouble with the cops for graffiti-spraying, egg-throwing, smoking weed and causing disturbances to his neighbors, just to name a few.</p><p>Memorably, in a 2013 Billboard interview, Bieber said, “don’t say I’m not talented. If you haven’t noticed, I wasn’t made. I was found.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-adam-levine---i-m-not-arrogant-i-m-cocky><strong>3. Adam Levine - "I'm Not Arrogant, I'm Cocky"</strong></h2><p>There is no denying <a href=#>Adam Levine</a>’s sex symbol status, but should that give him the liberty to act like a douche bag on the regular? The jury is out. In a July 2014 interview with GQ magazine, Levine addressed his perceivably arrogant reputation. He said, “I'm not arrogant. I'm cocky. It's different. Cocky is playful.” Others certainly would beg to disagree.</p><p>His attitude is apparent when watching him as a host on The Voice, where he speaks very highly of himself, and is often rude to the other judges.&nbsp;And, as for the amount of attention he received as a musician, well — he loves it. He told Details magazine, “I love attention. I can’t stand not having it.”</p><p></p><h2 id=2-kim-kardashian---published-book-of-her-selfies><strong>2. Kim Kardashian - Published Book Of Her Selfies</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> is perhaps one of the most insecure yet cocky celebrities known to man. She often complains on her family’s reality TV show how she doesn’t think she is skinny enough, or pretty enough, or fashionable enough. Yet, she’s regularly known to do or say things that keep us wondering whether her show personality is just an act.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For instance, the fact that Kardashian published a book containing only her own seflies certainly speaks to how confident she feels in her appearance. She’s often seen on their show taking pictures of herself and zoning the rest of her family out. There’s one thing for sure, vain is definitely her middle name. Additionally, in interviews, her family always points to her as the most conceited family member.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-kanye-west---i-m-a-creative-genius><strong>1. Kanye West - "I'm A Creative Genius"</strong></h2><p>There are approximately over 100,000 ridiculous<a href=#> Kanye West</a> quotes on why he thinks he’s so great. In fact, some may know him today more so for his erratic behavior and commentary than for his music and fashion endeavors. He's had random and arrogant situations arise — whether in person or via social media — with some big names including <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a> and even his pal <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>. It seems there are no lines he isn’t willing to cross.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the cockiest things West has said was: “For me, I’m a creative genius. There’s no other way to word it. I know you’re not supposed to say that about yourself, and I say things the wrong way a lot of times, but my intention is always positive.”</p><p>West has also compared himself to Shakespeare (“I am Shakespeare in the flesh”), Andy Warhol (“I am Warhol. I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation”) and Tupac (“I’m going to be the Tupac of clothing”). Whose rap does West most enjoy listening to? While his own, of course. He notoriously once said, “I’m my favorite rapper,” and "My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live."</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>: <a href=#>StarMagazine.com</a>, <a href=#>EOnline.com</a>, <a href=#>GQ.com</a>, <a href=#>WSJ.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqal2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mmKudXam8sHnCqJqksV2bvLN506GcoqpdpMSvecaopp1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-veronica-hamel-now-what-is-she-doing-today-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Where is Veronica Hamel now?
