The concept was described as a “pie-in-the-sky” idea. As of this writing, nothing about it is official.</p><p>The idea we heard regarding a discussion and nothing more, like I said, it’s been talked about as a pie-in-the-sky is a surprise No. 30 entrant and winning,” Meltzer wrote. “It could be something only a few people know but as best we can tell there is nothing official to it right now past a rumor.”</p><p>Meltzer also stated that the belief had been that, if it lined up with The Rock’s schedule, he’d likely face Roman Reigns in his last match at WrestleMania, and “The Great One” preferred to have the bout in Los Angeles, the site of WrestleMania 39.</p><p>Meltzer states in the report, “Originally, the belief was that if his schedule allowed for it, Johnson would do likely his last match at Mania with Reigns, who is a family member. This has been talked about for years, and Johnson wanted it in Los Angeles if he could do it.”</p><p>The Rock hasn’t competed in a match for WWE since WrestleMania 32, when he beat Erick Rowan in less than five seconds.</p><p>Before that, his last actual match occurred almost ten years ago at WrestleMania 29 when he lost the WWE Championship to John Cena. The Rock tore his abdominal and abductor muscles and suffered a hernia during the matchup. These injuries resulted in a delay in filming his Hercules movie to give him time to heal.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>The Rock: I Am The Head Of The Table, I Love The Idea Of ‘A WrestleMania’</a></p><p>What do you make of this report?
