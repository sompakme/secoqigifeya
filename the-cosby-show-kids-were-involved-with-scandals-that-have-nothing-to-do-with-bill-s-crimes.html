Then, a bit of a Cosby backlash began when the comedian made some statements about the young black community that upset many. Finally, Cosby’s legacy was destroyed forever when a large number of women came forward to accuse him of extremely serious and disturbing crimes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bill Cosby Flexes His Wealth To Reveal How Powerful He Still Is</a></span></p><p>After Bill Cosby went on trial and was convicted, he was sent to prison. When he was released from prison, a lot of people and <a href=#>celebrities reacted to Cosby being freed</a>. On top of following the ups and downs of Cosby’s legal situation, many people have been looking back at his career in a new light. For example, fans are <a href=#>disturbed by the time Cosby interviewed Sofia Vergara</a> and a controversial episode of The Cosby Show. As it turns out, Bill isn’t the only controversial Cosby show cast member as the of the sitcom’s child stars have been embroiled in scandals as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-lisa-bonet>What Happened To Lisa Bonet?</h2><p>At the height of The Cosby Show’s popularity, the sitcom’s stars were widely seen as being very wholesome. As it would later turn out, the reason for that is that even though <a href=#>Bill Cosby was doing dastardly things</a>, he wanted his show to be the most wholesome show on television. As a result, Cosby wanted the actors who played his TV kids to lead perfect lives. However, nobody is perfect and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several of the Cosby kids got involved in scandals</a>. For example, Lisa Bonet’s rebellious nature resulted in some notable controversies.</p><p>When The Cosby Show was still in production, Bill Cosby was one of the most powerful people in the entertainment busy. On top of using that clout to get away with his criminal activity, Cosby used his authority to control the people who worked for him. However, it has long been known that, unlike her co-stars, Lisa Bonet consistently rebelled against her TV dad. For example, Bonet starred in a movie in which she appeared in the buff even though she knew that would upset Cosby. As a result of all the times that Bonet clashed with Cosby, Lisa controversially left The Cosby Show and didn’t even appear in the sitcom’s finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Times We Could Hardly Tell Lisa Bonet And Zoë Kravitz Apart</a></span></p><p>In the years since The Cosby Show ended, Lisa Bonet has remained open and outspoken. On one occasion, that resulted in a notable scandal when she had the big talk every parent has with their child when they are coming of age. During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Bonet revealed that she actually provided her daughter, Zoë Kravitz, with an illegal substance. "The drug and sex talk was 'here's some drugs, don't have sex yet."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-sabrina-le-beauf>What Happened To Sabrina Le Beauf?</h2><p>Throughout most of her time starring in The Cosby Show, Sabrina Le Beauf went out of her way to remain on the good side of her bosses. However, at one time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">La Beauf got embroiled in a battle with The Cosby Show’s producers</a> since they wanted her on set even when her character wasn’t going to be on camera. After the dustup with producers, La Beauf spoke to The Washington Post about the situation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Sondra Huxtable, AKA Sabrina Le Beauf, From 'The Cosby Show'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"That is not working. You can't tell me 'we want you here' and 'be here for us,' if I am not going to work." On top of remaking about producer’s demands, Sabrina Le Beauf complained about missing out on more rewarding roles during the same interview. "Working in television you do not have the opportunity most times to do what you are capable of doing. Having been on the show for five years I have not been able to do what I am capable of doing. I feel cheated that 55 million people a week watch something that is not my best work." Bill Cosby reportedly stepped in later and helped La Beauf and producers make peace.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-raven-symon-eacute>What Happened To Raven-Symoné?</h2><p>After The Cosby Show came to an end, Raven-Symoné enjoyed more success than any of the other Cosby kids. After all, Raven-Symoné went on to Disney Channel stardom and then she became a talk show host. Unfortunately, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raven-Symoné said many things that upset a lot of observers</a> during her time as one of The View’s co-hosts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, a lot of times that Raven-Symoné got embroiled in controversy revolved around discussions of race. For example, when Raven-Symoné remarked that she wouldn’t hire anyone with a “ghetto” name like “Watermelondrea", people were outraged. Worse yet, when Univision host Rodner Figueroa got fired for comparing Michelle Obama to an ape, Raven-Symoné defended him by saying "Don't fire me from this right now, but some people do look like animals". Amazingly enough, those are only two of the many scandalous things that Raven-Symoné has said.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Raven-Symoné Has Said About Her Time On 'The View'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqKuSrnq0tM6wZKShlKh6tK%2FAp5uapF2staa%2BxGaYq51dqbWmxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-aldean-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Aldean News - Us Weekly</span></a>
