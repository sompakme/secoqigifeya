The “I Know What You Did Last Summer” collaborators later quarantined together <a href=#>during the coronavirus pandemic</a> in 2020, but they eventually pressed pause on their romance.</p><p>“Hey guys, we’ve decided to end our romantic relationship but our love for one another as humans is stronger than ever,” the pair <a href=#>wrote in a joint statement</a> via social media in November 2021. “We started our relationship as best friends and will continue to be best friends. We so appreciate your support from the beginning and moving forward. Camila and Shawn.”</p><p>At the time, a source told Us that the Canada native and his ex <a href=#>had “a ton of love and respect for each other”</a> but needed “a break from each other to evaluate” their relationship. “They’re not saying never, just not now,” the insider added. “It does hurt, but they’re both certain this is for the best. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have done it.”</p><p>The duo each <a href=#>channeled their heartbreak</a> into their songwriting as they went their separate ways. Last month, however, fans began to wonder <a href=#>whether Mendes and Cabello were back on</a> when they were caught getting cozy at <a href=#>Coachella</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Their bond was very special and they’ve stayed in contact even after their split,” a third source explained in April. “They realized that even though they’re not suited for each other in a romantic sense, they have a strong chemistry and <a href=#>will always remain close friends</a>.”</p><p>Following their festival outing, the “Havana” singers <a href=#>have been spotted together</a> on several occasions. Mendes and the X Factor alum held hands in New York City days before <a href=#>heading to New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium</a> on Friday, May 26, for <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>‘s Eras Tour. In footage shared via social media, the pair walked slightly apart as they made their way to the VIP section of the arena.</p><p>Watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly — on newsstands now — for more on Mendes and Cabello’s status.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ2euaJ5wpqZnqScpHqmxIysn5qvnmK6prrDnqpmq6Cau6W1zaBknq6Vp8ZusMCyZK2nl5rBqbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-facts-about-eminem-s-life-that-made-him-a-great-rapper.html><span>←</span><span>15 Facts About Eminem's Life That Made Him A Great Rapper</span></a>
