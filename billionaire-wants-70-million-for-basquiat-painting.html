It was part of an exhaustive art-buying spree that saw the art collector drop almost $100 million.</p><p>Basquiat was an American neo-expressionist painter who rose to prominence in the 1980s, he&nbsp;enjoyed great acclaim&nbsp;in the art world before <a href=#>his early death in 1988, when he was only&nbsp;27-years-old.</a></p><p>Coming in at 8-by-16 feet,&nbsp;Untitled, 1982&nbsp;is one of Basquiat's&nbsp;largest canvases. The images adorning the canvas&nbsp;feature a warm burst of colors deliberately brushed&nbsp;around&nbsp;a devilish-looking character with horns. It was one of many paintings he released&nbsp;in 1982.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“It’s the pinnacle year of Basquiat, 1982, and one of the largest paintings he did, that is filled with drips and Abstract Expressionist gestures,”</a> says Jean-Paul Engelen, America's&nbsp;President of Phillips who will run the auction. "The imagery reveals the artist balancing becoming a kind of rock star given his background and environment... seeing the other side of the coin to fame and success."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Monet, Picasso, & Van Gogh Paintings Expected To Sell For $47 Million At Sotheby Auction</a></span></p><p>“He’s besting Andy Warhol&nbsp;for popularity now,” Mr. Engelen said. “Young people and classic collectors relate to him.”</p><p>If the painting sells for the $70 million asking price, it will continue to rank as the second most expensive piece from Basquiat’s body of work. The most expensive is another Untitled, 1982, painting that&nbsp;was&nbsp;also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased by Maezawa for $110.5 million at Sotheby’s in May 2017</a>.
