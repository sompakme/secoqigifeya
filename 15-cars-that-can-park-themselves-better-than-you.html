If a vehicle enthusiast were to travel through time from the 1980s to today, the word "shock" would not even begin to explain the feelings and emotions he or she would go through. Cars have come so far in the last two decades, and the future holds even more promise of transforming cars into transportation machines that handle and look nothing like what we have today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Features such as adaptive cruise controls, lane centering steering, automatic braking and steering, and self-parking steering are fast becoming basic. In the near future, almost all the cars on the roads, especially in first world nations, will have the ability to drive themselves, since there are already some driverless vehicles on the road today.</p><p>Vehicle manufacturers today are breaking barriers and stepping out into transforming their cars into smart machines that can make decisions on their own and communicate with each other. The autonomous vehicles are sure to reduce the number of accidents to almost nil, improve passenger experience in every way, increase the speeds on the roads, ensure we never take a wrong turn, and offer so much more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although there is still so much we expect from the cars in the future, these cars sure give us a clear glimpse of what to expect. These vehicles have the ability to park themselves, some require the driver to work the gears and brakes, but some do not need human input at all. Most of these are cars that hit the markets in 2016, just imagine how advanced the cars in 2017 will be.</p><h2 id=15-the-bmw-7-series><strong>15. The BMW 7 Series</strong></h2><p>Via Pinterest</p><p>Although the BMW 7 Series hit the market in 2015, it was still one of the best vehicles in 2016 in every way considering that it had the ability to park itself back then. This BMW was the most innovative vehicle in its class, and it set the foundation for which cars of the future would be built from. The level of technology, performance, and comfort in this vehicle make the driver and the passengers enjoy an unmatched luxury experience. Can you imagine a vehicle offering massaging seat functions and an expansive legroom at the back that can allow you to stretch out? That is just the beginning when it comes to what this vehicle offers. Since this BMW is on this list, it has the ability to park itself, although it is limited to nose-in parking. The good thing here is that the driver can step out of the car upon reaching the parking spot, command the car to park itself, and it will. The car will also get itself out of the parking spot on its own and wait for the driver to get in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-toyota-prius><strong>14. Toyota Prius</strong></h2><p>Via Motor Trend</p><p>Although some movies and shows like Top Gear might have painted the Toyota Prius in bad light, it is still one of the most popular hybrid vehicles in the world and it is fast replacing models that insist on remaining in the past. The Prius is the best-selling hybrid vehicle in the world and it is helping to reduce the amount of pollution that vehicles emit every day that is damaging our environment because it is a hybrid with top-notch fuel saving technology. The 2016 Toyota Prius comes with a much smaller and lighter lithium-ion battery, it has occupant protection features, as well as crash-prevention technologies, all working together to protect the motorists. Since the Prius is the car for the future, this version has Intelligent Parking Assist, which makes it easy for a driver to part without the fear of mistakes. In addition, this Prius can also automatically unpack itself, a feature that most other vehicles on this list do not have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-2016-ford-focus><strong>13. 2016 Ford Focus</strong></h2><p>Via TopSpeed</p><p>Since this list is not limited to luxury cars, the 2016 Ford Focus is a&nbsp;big relief for drivers whose pockets are not too deep, but want to enjoy the self-parking technology. Many "reasonably priced cars" are coming with this and even more technology and it seems like the 2016 Ford Focus is leading the pack. The Ford Focus uses Blue Oval's Active Park Assist technology, which is just a few hundred dollars, peanuts compared to what other active park assist technologies cost. The technology in the Ford Focus also includes features such as the SYNC 3 infotainment system, 10-speaker Sony sound setup, and heated front seats. The Active Park Assist technology will require the driver to sit behind the wheel and operate the breaks and the accelerator. The driver needs to be keen since the technology does not replace the driver's sense of judgement and attention, especially when it is raining heavily or where there may be objects that absorb ultrasonic waves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-skoda-superb><strong>12. Skoda Superb</strong></h2><p>Via CarAdvice</p><p>Skoda Superb is one of the latest products that Skoda Auto, a Czech automobile manufacturer, released to the market last year, a car that has a cutting-edge exterior and a luxurious interior. People love Skoda because of its value for money, a feature that is also evident in the Superb, in addition to its amazing spacious interiors and beautiful razor-sharp headlights. Being an electric car built for the upmarket clientele, this car will arguably offer you as much pleasure driving it as the best ones on this list, in addition to looking great and helping you save a few dollars on its purchase. The SE, SE L Executive, and Sportline models have the park assist as an optional feature, whereas the Laurin and Klement trim come with it as a standard feature. This car will of course park better than you on your best day, but it will require that you operate the gear and brakes as it squeezes itself into that "impossible" parking space.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-volvo-xc90><strong>11. Volvo XC90</strong></h2><p>Via YouTube</p><p>If you love Volvo, then you know just how great the brand new Volvo XC90 is, or at least you would know what to expect. This is without a doubt the safest, most luxurious, and most technologically-advanced Volvo we had in the market in 2016, which is why it has self-parking technology among other advances. This big and beautiful SUV might prove to be a challenge to some drivers when it comes to parking, but thanks to the park-assist system, drivers never need to worry about any type of parking. The Volvo Active Park Assist Pilot's Xenium package comes with a panoramic sunroof made of powered glass as well as a 360° camera, of course for an additional cost. However, you will need to sit on the driver's seat to control the car's speed as it is parking itself; it will accelerate on its own, but you will need to apply the brakes a bit.</p><h2 id=10-volkswagen-golf><strong>10. Volkswagen Golf</strong></h2><p>Via South Centre VW</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Volkswagen Golf is an amazing piece of German engineering that has proven itself year after year that it is one of the best all-round vehicles in the market. This car might appear small, but it is the right size for anyone in the market for the most affordable, convenient, and technologically forward hatchback. Since this VW is on the list, it comes with a Park Steering Assistant, which will let the driver know whether the car can fit in a particular parking space and steer itself perfectly into such a space. The driver only needs to control the speed and the gears as the car parks itself. In addition to Park Assist, the technology built in here includes Front Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, Blind Spot Monitor, Park Pilot, Rear Traffic Alert, and Lane Assist. All the above including a rear-view camera and a dashboard color display will come with a small cost, a cost that is worth every cent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-2016-lincoln-mks><strong>9. 2016 Lincoln MKS</strong></h2><p>Via 2018 New Car - Price, News & Reviews</p><p>The 2016 Lincoln MKS was the largest and most luxurious Lincoln sedan last year&nbsp;since the Lincoln Continental Flagship came to take over most of the glory early this year. However, the MKS is still one of the best cars out there, since it is fast, competent, and its luxury is reserved and definitely understated. The MKS is huge and can at times be a challenge to drivers in the city and pose an even bigger challenge when parking. However, the MKS's Technology Package comes with an Active Park Assist, a system that uses sonar-based tech to identify parking spots and helps the driver to park with great ease. Upon engaging the Park Assist, the car takes over the steering and guides the driver on how and when to brake and step on the gas. In addition, this technology package comes with an adaptive cruise control that has brake support, a lane-keeping system, and collision mitigation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-2016-chrysler-200><strong>8. 2016 Chrysler 200</strong></h2><p>Via Vehicle History</p><p>The 2016 Chrysler 200 is an amazing vehicle, with its&nbsp;performance so good it can easily be the best mid-sized sedan in the market today.

This Chrysler has some of the latest technologies in the motor vehicle industry, technologies that include parking assistance, advanced brake assistance, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and forward collision warning. This car will help a driver with Perpendicular and Parallel parking, meaning that parking problems will be ancient history as long as you have this car. As is the case with most other vehicles on this list, the parking assistance will take over all the difficult aspects involved, leaving you with controlling the brakes or intervening if you are not comfortable at any point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-2016-volkswagen-passat><strong>7. 2016 Volkswagen Passat</strong></h2><p>Via AutoGuide.com</p><p>The 2016 Volkswagen Passat is an outstanding vehicle that is a considerable improvement from the 2015 version.
