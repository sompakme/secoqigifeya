Curiosity was peaked, and the reason behind this breakup became the new fixation for fans that needed to know more.</p><h2 id=ryan-oubre-suggests-clara-berghaus-was-39-racially-tone-deaf-39><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ryan Oubre Suggests Clara Berghaus Was 'Racially Tone-Deaf'</span></h2><p>When they entered into an interracial relationship, Ryan and Clara seemed to be completely at ease, and neither of them expressed concern about the situation.

He went on to say, "The Black experience and Black culture are not monolithic, there's no one size fits all shoe. It's ever-evolving and changing with time."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Are AJ And Stephanie Still Married?</a></span></p><h2 id=ryan-oubre-claims-clara-berghaus-was-disrespectful-to-his-family><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ryan Oubre Claims Clara Berghaus Was Disrespectful To His Family</span></h2><p>Ryan is a family man and admits that the was taken aback by Clara's conduct in front of his relatives.

Clara thought counseling was going well and admits to feeling blindsided when Ryan filed for divorce and took formal steps to end their marriage.</p><h2 id=the-cameras-prevented-ryan-from-opening-up-tough-conversations><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Cameras Prevented Ryan From Opening Up Tough Conversations</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ryan Oubre admits that he saw some red flags at the beginning of this interracial relationship. He went on to tell fans that he felt Clara Berghaus lacked the ability to connect with Black Americans but that he wasn't able to bring up the topic for fear that it would be somehow misconstrued by the press.</p><p>"You need to at least attempt to understand the culture you married into," said Ryan. "We avoided having these conversations on camera as I knew this was a complex topic and did not want it to seem as I was weaponizing the camera against her. I will own that—I intentionally derailed conversations or avoided them because I knew where it would go."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What The 'Married At First Sight' Cast Looks Like For Season 14</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-oubre-and-clara-berghaus-39-divorce-statements><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ryan Oubre And Clara Berghaus' Divorce Statements</span></h2><p>When it became public knowledge that Ryan and Clara were processing through a divorce, they each took a moment to reveal their side of the break-up story with their fans.

She complained about every aspect of their intimacy and made it clear that Ryan wasn't a match behind closed bedroom doors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Married At First Sight': Are Myrla And Johnny Really Dating?</a></span></p><h2 id=ryan-lost-trust-in-clara-after-she-aired-their-private-details><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ryan Lost Trust In Clara After She Aired Their Private Details</span></h2><p>When Clara used the Married At First Sight platform to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">air her bedroom grievances, </a>Ryan felt betrayed. He wasn't on board with sharing their personal details with the public and felt that by complaining about him in this manner and dragging his name, Clara had betrayed him. Try as he may, Ryan was unable to see past this moment and says this made him realize he would never be able to fully trust Clara again. He knew at this point that his relationship was forever damaged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-oubre-and-clara-berghaus-39-divorce-reactions><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ryan Oubre And Clara Berghaus' Divorce Reactions</span></h2><p>Ryan Oubre promised Clara Berghaus' parents he would always treat her with respect, and he kept his word. Proving that he was an honorable man, Ryan didn't bash Clara in any way during their separation. He kept his social media posts respectable and informative for his fan base but stopped short of being rude or airing too much of his dirty laundry. On the other hand, Clara retaliated with a tell-all interview and bashed Ryan. She also used her breakup as a money-making opportunity by tantalizing fans to tune in to Married At First Sight to learn all about the juicy details that led to a breakdown in her marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-had-deep-concerns-about-having-children-with-clara><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Ryan Had Deep Concerns About Having Children With Clara</span></h2><p>When Ryan Oubre and Clara Berghaus got married, they set their sights on having children and expanding their family. However, Ryan began having doubts about whether Clara could handle having an interracial child. He felt that her conduct wasn't a reflection of someone that respected people of color and that wasn't how he wanted his children to be raised.</p><p>Ryan stated, “By marrying into a different race/culture you inherently adopt parts of their identity. Most importantly, your kids 100 percent will, and your kids will need you to help navigate it. They’ll need you to help teach, train, and understand as best you can – a systematically racist system. Choosing not to attempt to understand and educate yourself is a red flag.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Married at First Sight’s Clara Berghaus Celebrates Signing Divorce Papers After Ryan Oubre Split</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipspmeYry2rtGeZJykkaeubq7Eq56hmaWoeq6t0augnpxdlsFussirqq1lo560qcCMnKauqJyaeqW11aipnJ1dmbK1rcilZKudkai8r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./russell-westbrook-s-wife-slams-espn-over-vampire-allegations.html><span>←</span><span>Russell Westbrooks Wife Slams ESPN Over Vampire Allegations</span></a>
