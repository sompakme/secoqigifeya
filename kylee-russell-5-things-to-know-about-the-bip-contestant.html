You deserve someone that without a shadow of doubt chooses you and only you every single day of the week,” Kylee told <a href=# rel=noopener>BachelorNation.com</a> in a September 2023 interview, adding: “ If he wanted to he would, ladies.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about the BiP season 9 contestant:</p><h3>1. Kylee Was a Contestant on Zach Shallcross’ Season of ‘The Bachelor’</h3><p>Kylee competed on Zach’s season 27 of The Bachelor and was eliminated during week five. She was one of the first women to be dumped virtually after Zach contracted COVID-19.</p><p>Even though she was disappointed that Zach rejected her, Kylee told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Charlotte Observer</a> that she has “no hard feelings” toward him. “I just think at the end of the day he wasn’t my person. That’s OK. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve a happy ending,” Kylee told the outlet in March 2023.</p><h3>2. Kylee Was Involved In Some Drama on ‘The Bachelor’</h3><p>During week four, Kylee interrupted a conversation between Zach and contestant <strong>Anastasia Keramidas</strong>. After Anastasia said she just “needed a few more minutes,” Kylee replied, “Please just let me have him. I don’t want to fight.” Anastasia then told the camera, “The fight comment was a little bit much for me.”</p><p>Following the incident, Kylee claimed to Zach that Anastasia came onto the show to build her social media following. Zach dismissed Anastasia from the ABC series soon after.</p><p>Drama escalated during the <a href=#>“Women Tell All”</a> episode when contestant <strong>Genevie Mayo</strong> called out Anastasia for making microaggressions toward Kylee.</p><p>“Never in a million years did I ever make someone feel as though I would harm them, let alone physically harm them,” Kylee told the Charlotte Observer in March 2023. “It hurt my feelings. Like, ’Why did your mind immediately go to that place?’ So Genevie made a great point and simply educated Anastasia — ‘OK, this might not be what you meant, but it’s showing unconscious bias.’”</p><h3>3. Is There Anyone Specific Kylee Wants To Meet on ‘BiP’?</h3><p>Kylee shared that she is interested in meeting season 19 <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> runner-up <a href=#><strong>Aven Jones</strong></a>.</p><p>“I have been intrigued by him since his season on The Bachelorette, as well as seeing him on social media,” she told BachelorNation.com. “I am hopeful he will be on the sand and interested to see if we form a love connection.”</p><h3>4. What Kylee Is Looking for in Love</h3><p>According to her<a href=# rel=noopener>ABC bio</a>, Kylee is “passionate about helping new mothers and can’t wait to have a baby of her own ASAP.” The reality star also “falls in love hard and fast” and is ready for the “soccer mom life.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>5. Kylee Is a Registered Postpartum Nurse and Former NBA Dancer</h3><p>Kylee graduated from nursing school in December 2021 and currently works in the Mother Baby Postpartum unit at Atrium Health in Charlotte, North Carolina.
