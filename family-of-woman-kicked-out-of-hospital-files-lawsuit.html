Dawson was given an oxygen tank and several hours later was informed she would be discharged, even after she demanded more care after facing shortness of breath.&nbsp;John Tadlock, a former Blountstown police officer, <a href=# rel=nofollow>was called</a> around 4:45 a.m. after the hospital discharged Dawson for “disorderly conduct and trespassing.” When Dawson collapsed next to the patrol car during the attempted&nbsp;arrest, she was taken back into the hospital where she was pronounced dead at 6:24 a.m.</p><p>On Saturday (July 16), the family listed the charges of false imprisonment, lack of emergency care, battery and a civil rights claim towards against&nbsp;Calhoun-Liberty Hospital, two of its former employees, the city of Blountstown and Tadlock. The former cop resigned in March.&nbsp;“Up until this point neither [the hospital nor the city] has been willing to talk. That left us with no choice but to file against both of them,” attorney Daryl Parks said on Monday.</p><p>A medical examiner cited Dawson’s cause of death a blood clot due to being excessively overweight.</p><p>Drew Peacock, an emergency medical technician, and Jennifer Waldorff, a nurse were fired from the hospital after an investigation showed several errors during their interaction with Dawson. The hospital was also fined $45,000 by Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration.</p><p>A separate&nbsp;investigation by the Florida state attorney Glenn Hess found that Tadlock’s behavior was”appropriate under the circumstances and there was no criminal law violation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5uurrXLsmSonl2bubC%2ByJ2YZq%2Bfoq6vedahpmacmZqxbq3FrZyrZZKatq%2BzjKSgnKOVmXqwwdNmpp9lmKTAsbXTmqNmpJGswLa102ZrbHBmZX9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwayne-johnson-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>dwayne johnson | TheRichest</span></a>
