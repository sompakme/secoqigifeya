Swift, 34, kicked off her concerts at Accor Stadium in Sydney on Friday, which Perry watched from the VIP tent alongside Rita Ora, Taiki Waititi and Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce.

During the show, Perry was spotted grooving to Swift’s sick beats, posed for selfies with her fellow A-list concertgoers and traded friendship bracelets with fans.</p><p class=p1>Perry also uploaded footage of herself singing along to Swift’s “Bad Blood,” squashing any remnants of their past feud. (Fans have long believed the track was penned about the women’s falling out.)</p><p class=p1>Ahead of the concert, Perry met up with Swift backstage. In a sweet selfie, Perry sported a black pinstripe vest with matching trousers and chunky silver necklaces, while Swift wore the teal version of her <i>Lover</i>-era bodysuit.</p><p class=p2>Swift and Perry became friends in 2009, shortly after they both burst onto the music scene. As the years went on, however, the two women sparked feud speculation. They each briefly dated <strong>John Mayer</strong>, and rumors later swirled that Perry poached Swift’s backup dancers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Katy-Perry-Danced-the-Night-Away-at-Old-Friend-Taylor-Swift-Eras-Tour-3.jpg><p class=p2>“She did something so horrible. I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy! It had to do with business,” Swift claimed to <i>Rolling Stone </i>in 2014. “She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I’m surprisingly non-confrontational — you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it.”</p><p class=p1>Swift vowed to never mention Perry publicly again. The two pop stars buried the hatchet by 2018, and one year later, Perry appeared in Swift’s “You Need to Calm Down” music video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Katy-Perry-Danced-the-Night-Away-at-Old-Friend-Taylor-Swift-Eras-Tour-4.jpg><p class=p1>“We saw each other at a party and walked up to each other and hugged it out and talked about things and then saw each other again at another party,” Swift said on the U.K.’s <i>Capital Breakfast </i>radio show in June 2019. “She and I have been fine for a while, like, really on good terms. … We wanted to make sure that was solid between us before we ever, you know, made the public aware.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>One month later, Perry revealed that they had learned to trust one another again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Katy-Perry-Danced-the-Night-Away-at-Old-Friend-Taylor-Swift-Eras-Tour-2.jpg><p class=p1>“I just thought, you know, she was about to embark on something new and big and needed the support,” Perry said <a href=#>on KIIS 1065’s <i>The Kyle & Jackie O Show</i></a> that July, referring to Swift’s 2018 <i>Reputation Tour</i>. ”And truly, as I was finishing mine, I realized how much we have in common. And maybe there’s only five other people in the world that can have the same type of conversations and understand where we’re coming from, and that we should celebrate our commonality and our friendship and to be able to be there for each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSuerGx0auwZpmkqbKvsNJmpqWcXZu%2FqrHNnWStmamhvLN50rCgn6yjYrKzrdJmq6itomK2r3nSspunnalk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-kelce-s-former-teammate-beau-allen-jokes-he-s-a-jobless-bum.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Kelce's Former Teammate Beau Allen Jokes He's a 'Jobless Bum'</span></a>
