Taylor is 26 years old. However, according to jail records, he was released on Saturday.</p><p>Gary Taylor was detained once more on the day he was scheduled to appear in court for a bond hearing. Arthur Horne, Bates’ lawyer, was surprised when his client was denied bond.</p><p>A second man in the crowd was slain hours later because the scenario was so chaotic. Police have not stated whether the shootings are connected; however, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WREG</a> has learned that Bates and Taylor are connected.</p><p>According to the victim’s lawyer Art Horne on Tuesday, Taylor is the mother of a child born to Bates’ sister.</p><p>The New 1017, the record company run by rap icon Gucci Mane, is home to Mac Critter. Horne wishes that people would only pass judgment on his client slowly.</p><p>Horne remarked, <strong>“He’s an excellent young man. He doesn’t have a track record, and we are confident that he will be acquitted of all allegations so that he can resume his musical career.”</strong></p><p>According to detectives, a witness named Gary Taylor, 26 was the shooter. The Shelby County District Attorney’s Office said that Taylor was unintentionally released shortly after his arrest.</p><p>Taylor was detained once more on Tuesday.</p><p>Horne thinks this contributed to Bates’s being refused bond considering what transpired with the co-defendant. According to Horne, no bond was set for any of the parties involved in this case.</p><p>A witness claims that Bates ordered Taylor to get out of his car and come to them while Bates was in an SUV with three other persons.&nbsp;</p><p>Officers said that at that point, the four guys brandished weapons, and one of them fired the shots that would ultimately murder Taylor.</p><p>They are well-known gang members, according to a witness. Horne said he was ignorant of his client’s gang affiliation, nevertheless.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC5wJxknKqZqcGmvoymrKuclad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./louis-partridge-reacts-to-olivia-rodrigo-dating-rumors.html><span>←</span><span>Louis Partridge Reacts to Olivia Rodrigo Dating Rumors</span></a>
