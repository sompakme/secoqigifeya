Nonetheless, the British actor has managed to make his presence known since he started headlining The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2015 and <a href=#>having a reputation for being one of the rudest celebs</a> in the business. Over the years, he has had a lot of memorable moments on the show, including all his hit Carpool Karaoke segments and crosswalk performances.</p><p>More recently, Corden also shocked everyone (yet again) when he announced in 2022 that <a href=#>he would only be doing the show for one more year</a> before saying goodbye for good. Love him or hate him, the late-night landscape certainly shifted after he left. As for what the future brings for Corden, it is safe to say that he has got time to figure things out. The host/actor has amassed quite a net worth after all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are James Corden's Most Profitable Movies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated July 2023:</strong> James Corden left late night tv for good in April 2023. Since that time, he has been living a low-key lifestyle, which is not surprising given that Corden's decision for departure came from wanting to spend more time with his three children, Max, 11, Carey, 8, and Charlotte, 5, as well as his wife, Julia.</p><p>The plan after ending The Late Late Show was to move back to London. As such, it could be that Corden is using some of his massive $70 million fortune to purchase the perfect abode there. And while waiting to find said place is enjoying a bit of downtime that he has not had in decades.</p><h2 id=james-corden-rose-to-fame-after-moving-to-hollywood>James Corden Rose To Fame After Moving To Hollywood</h2><p>Hard as it may be to believe now but there was a time when Corden was a relative unknown. To be clear though, he already had some success in the business long before making his way stateside. Corden had started out as a cast member in the late 90s BBC comedy Out of Tune. Since then, he starred in several more British films and tv shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52588740.png><p>These included the Channel 5 dramedy Teachers where Corden also ended up meeting Ben Winston. Since then, the two men would keep in constant touch as Corden pursued on-camera jobs and Winston eventually co-founded the highly successful production company Fulwell73.</p><p>Since Teachers too, Corden successfully worked to establish himself as both a comedian and a show host. Years before landing the Late Late Show gig, he did Boyz Unlimited, James Corden’s World Cup Live, and Horne & Corden. Several years later, Corden made his way to Hollywood and never looked back.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>An Audience Member Called James Corden Completely Cold During Commercial Breaks On The Late Late Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the help of Winston and Fulwell73, Corden took the late-night scene by storm. From the very beginning, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were determined to shake things up</a>. “James and I had no inhibitions as we felt like we had nothing to lose,” Winston explained. Corden and his team went on introduced segments like Carpool Karaoke, which went on to inspire its own Apple series. And just like that, Corden became a major Hollywood player, picking up 11 Emmy wins so far.</p><h2 id=this-is-where-james-corden-rsquo-s-net-worth-stands-today>This Is Where James Corden’s Net Worth Stands Today</h2><p>Recent estimates indicate that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corden’s net worth can be as high as $70 million today</a>. It is also likely that a huge part of his earnings comes from his Late Late Show hosting stint. Corden took over for former host Craig Ferguson back in March 2016. Since then, he has reportedly managed to negotiate a salary anywhere between $4 million and $5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar51524614-1.jpg><p>Back in 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Corden also secured a new contract with CBS</a>. More importantly, it is believed that he managed to secure a significant salary bump for himself.</p><p>"James Corden has burned his way to the top of American television with a daring, energetic and inventive broadcast that stands out in the late-night space," David Nevins, CBS Corporation’s Chief Creative Officer, said in a statement.</p><p>"James and his shows are a great source of pride to CBS, and it’s exciting to extend our relationship well into the future."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Celebs Hate James Corden, And Here's Why</a></span></p><p>Moreover, the salary talks were held around the same time that Fulwell73 was in renegotiation with CBS too. By this time, Corden had already become a partner at the production company himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-ways-james-corden-made-or-continues-to-make-his-fortune>Other Ways James Corden Made Or Continues To Make His Fortune</h2><p>Outside his now-defunct hosting stint where <a href=#>critics got their wish by Corden leaving late-night television</a>, Corden and Fulwell73 have also been involved in several other high-profile Hollywood projects. In recent years, the company has been behind the Grammys and Friends: The Reunion. They are also currently producing The Kardashians on Hulu.</p><p>At the same time, it is also worth noting that Corden continued acting once he arrived in Hollywood too. Over the years, <a href=#>he starred in films such as Begin Again and Into the Woods</a>. He also became the voice of the titular character in the Peter Rabbit movies. In 2019, Corden also starred in the big-screen adaptation of Cats (which flopped despite its impressive ensemble).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52289247.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to hosting, acting, and producing, Corden has also secured some major brand partnerships in recent years. For instance, he partnered with Japanese skincare brand SK-II for a YouTube series that also stars Chloe Grace Moretz.</p><p>Corden was also announced as a global partner for WW (formerly Weight Watchers) International back in 2021. For the late-night host, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the partnership came out of a desire to achieve a healthier self</a>. "The weight is not the issue, it's the wellness of it I am ready to tackle. I'm going to take this year and work towards getting healthy," he explained. “I called WW because I absolutely believe that they have the tools in place to help me make this change."</p><p>This partnership ended in April 2023, with both sides being amicable in the split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, aside from his Late Late Show, fans got to see Corden in the dramedy Mammals, which he also produced. While it garnered a decent audience, there has yet to be an announcement from Amazon as to whether a Season Two is on the books.</p><p>Aside from this, the actor also lent his voice in the English version of the upcoming animated film Animals United 2: The Chilldown, which is due out in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqWVqHqku9GdnKdlnprBbsPOq6uhZZyWwaZ5y5qrnmWjnby4ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-times-hayley-atwell-s-had-all-eyes-on-her-style.html><span>←</span><span>20 Times Hayley Atwells Had All Eyes On Her Style</span></a>
