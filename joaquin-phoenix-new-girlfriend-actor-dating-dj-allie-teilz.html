The 39-year-old actor — who was most famously linked to <strong>Liv Tyler</strong> in the 1990s — is dating DJ <strong>Allie Teilz</strong>, 20, a source confirms to <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>.</p><p>The two were spotted out and about on Saturday, Nov. 9, in Rome, Italy, where Phoenix was promoting his new movie, Her. Both wore black pants and black Chuck Taylor All-Star <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> as they took in the sights of the European city.</p><p>"Girls are just fascinated with him. They seek him out," a source tells <strong>Us</strong> of the eccentric Oscar nominee. "There is a lot going on there, as you can imagine…It's not the typical girl that wants to be with him."</p><p>Teilz is certainly not typical. A native of Arizona, she started DJ-ing in New York City when she was just 16. In high school, she would fly to Vegas on Thursday afternoons and "work the shows" from Friday morning to Sunday night, she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Bullett Media</a> in an interview earlier this year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I had a complete double life and lied about my age, obviously, but I was really getting involved in the music world and starting to meet people," she explained. "It wasn't a good world for me being as young as I was."</p><p>High school wasn't an ideal setting, either. "I didn't have many friends," she confessed to Bullett. "When I was at school I had headphones in and was always in the computer lab listening to music or writing — I was never there. The school hated me. They wanted to kick me out."</p><p>Phoenix, for his part, has also deviated from a typical path. And like Teilz, he has a passion for music. In 2010, he and <strong>Casey Affleck</strong> filmed a mockumentary, I'm Still Here, which chronicled his (fake) retirement from acting and subsequent attempts to become a hip hop star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5Gmwqq6jKmfqJ2ensVuf5hmm5qsmaO0brDJZpilpJmaerWxyKWxZmpgYsCmsYyaZKmhk6nCs7GMa2dqa2FpfnJ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-tall-is-anna-cockrell-everything-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>How Tall is Anna Cockrell?
