ODB’s&nbsp;ultimate goal is to actually drive her food truck into a stadium and kick some ass, and <a href=# rel=noopener>IMPACT Wrestling</a> is helping her check one of those boxes off of her list.</p><p>recently spoke with Chris Van Vliet and confirmed she is returning to the ring with IMPACT Wrestling in the near future.</p><p>“I am actually getting back in the ring. So IMPACT obviously called me and that’s the cool thing about stuff, I’ve never burnt a bridge in wrestling. Yeah, we all have our bad moments and stuff and whatever you want to when you want to tell everyone to go F themselves. IMPACT was awesome, TNA was my home and they buzzed me and every time I’m like ‘Oh gosh. Oh boy, here we go’. But they were like ‘Hey, do you want to come back and see what happens? And possibly bring the food truck?’ So that’s my ultimate goal, to actually drive my ODB’s Meat and Greet into a stadium and kick some ass.”</p><p>While she didn’t confirm when it would take place, ODB said she’s looking forward to going “home” and namedropped a few potential opponents she’s had her eye on.</p><p>“I see that Jazz is there. No one’s ever seen me and Jazz go at it on TV. And Jordynne Grace is another good one and Taya. I love how the Knockouts are still going as the Knockouts, you know what I mean? They’re all so different and they’re keeping it good. I just love all those girls. They’re a lot younger than me but that will be fun.”</p><p></p><p>Former TNA Knockout&nbsp;&nbsp;also recently spoke with WrestleZone Managing Editor Bill Pritchard about her return to wrestling, pointing out a couple of names she’s a fan of—and would like to square off with.</p><p>“Killer Kelly is someone I haven’t ever met, or had the ability to work with since I was retired as she was coming up and I’ve been watching her matches for both research and as a fan. I think for myself as a ‘former’ professional wrestler—or, I’m back into it, I don’t know what to even call myself anymore,” Wilde said, “but yeah, there’s definitely that dual interest where I might be researching who is on the up-and-up, but I also watch as a fan and that’s what connects me. Kiera Hogan is another one, but even going over to NXT, Io Shirai, she is so incredible. There’s just so much motivation out there, so I think even if I’m just watching matches as a fan, it’s definitely motivation as well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFqb3FqYGK8pa6MnKannpmnurR50Z6rrqqeYsGwecimp5qbpGLEs7HSraOippc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mariah-carey-s-dating-history-derek-jeter-nick-cannon-more.html><span>←</span><span>Mariah Careys Dating History: Derek Jeter, Nick Cannon, More</span></a>
