Micheail Ward,&nbsp;24, faced first-degree murder alongside a charge for aggravated use of a weapon.</p><p>“Hadiya is serving a death sentence handed down by Micheail Ward, and all the family is doing life as a result of her death,” Hadiya’s mother Cleopatra Cowley said. On Jan. 29, 2013, the teenager was gunned down in Kenwood, <a href=# id=auto-tag_chicago_1 data-tag=chicago>Chicago</a>‘s Harsh Park. The King College Prep High School honor roll student was with a group of friends when Ward mistook them for rival gang members and opened fire. The bullets fatally struck the teenager in the back.&nbsp;“Never in my existence did I think that my baby, my baby girl who gave meaning to my life, never in a million years did I think someone would come cause her harm,” Cowley <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Once news of the student’s death ignited conversations about the senseless gun and gang violence across the country, former first lady and Chicago native <a href=# id=auto-tag_michelle-obama_1 data-tag=michelle-obama>Michelle Obama</a> was moved to speak on how close to home Hadiya’s death hit for her.</p><p>“As I visited with the Pendleton family at Hadiya’s funeral, I couldn’t get over how familiar they felt to me, because what I realized was Hadiya’s family was just like my family. Hadiya Pendleton was me, and I was her…,” Obama said, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">MSNBC</a>. “But I got to grow up and go to Princeton and Harvard Law School and have a career and family and the most blessed life I could ever imagine…And Hadiya? Oh, we know that story. This isn’t some war zone half a world away, this is our home. This kind of violence is what young people here face every single day.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Another suspect, Kenneth Williams, was also arrested and deemed guilty of aggravated battery. Authorities state he was the getaway driver. His sentencing trial is still forthcoming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX52upbXYmmSpnZ6ZuabAzqdkpq2imbKzsdFmqp6mpJq7pLHDZquoZaCntrS7zWZtbGhkbH9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-stern-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>David Stern Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
