He has taken Buffalo to the postseason twice (in 2017 and 2019), posting 25 wins against 23 losses.</p><p>The Bills went 10-6 last season and clinched the top wild card spot in the AFC. Their thrilling season ended in overtime against the Houston Texans in the Wild Card Round, but it was a step in the right direction anyway.</p><p>McDermott took the Bills to the playoffs in his first season (a 9-7 record), ending the team's 18-year postseason drought. They took a step back in 2018 and finished 6-10, but it didn't take McDermott and general manager Brandon Beane long to rebuild this club into a playoff team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">[Report] NFL Could Have More Saturday Games If NCAA Football Season Is Canceled</a></strong></p><p>McDermott previously served as the Carolina Panthers' defensive coordinator under Ron Rivera from 2011 to 2016. McDermott built an elite defense that guided Carolina to the postseason in 2013, 2014 and 2015 - making it to Super Bowl 50 in the latter year.</p><p>With Tom Brady leaving the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in free agency, the Bills are widely considered to be the favorites in the AFC East - led by young stars&nbsp;in quarterback Josh Allen, superstar cornerback Tre'Davious White, running back Devin Singletary, wide receiver Stefon Diggs and defensive tackle Ed Oliver.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before McDermott was hired by the Bills, they hadn't made the postseason since 1999, and they had only recorded two winning seasons in the 21st century. But McDermott and Beane have quickly changed the dynamic of this franchise, and the Bills are in primary contention to compete for Super Bowls over the long run. This long-term extension is extremely well deserved.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rock And Redbird Capital Have Bought The XFL For $15 Million</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6tompmhubR50qKep2Wjmq6vecycm56qnaTBtXnTqGScp56pv6Kv02acsayVo8Cqu81o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bob-saget-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Bob Saget Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
