While it was a small part, after growing up, it gave her enough exposure to the industry that she decided to become a professional actress.</p><p>Before that, however, she starred in 1989 in the family comedy film ‘ Little Monsters.’ She played the role of a little monster, while her brothers, Ben and Fred, starred as Eric and Brian, respectively. While the movie fared poorly at the box office, after releasing on DVD, viewers at home universally liked it.&nbsp;&nbsp;These two appearances were her only projects as a teen.</p><p>A decade later, Kala decided to try her luck again in the industry and appeared in 1999 on MTV’s anthology series’ Undressed.’ She appeared as Gwen in the episodes’ There in the Van’ and’ I Know What You Did Last Hummer.’ In 2001, she was seen as a younger version of a character named Paula in the ‘Eric’s Naughty No-No’ episode on the popular series ‘That 70s Show.’ Her appearance on’ That 70s Show’ proved fruitful as she received more offers to play guest roles on various popular shows.</p><p>She was next seen in the comedy series ‘ Diagnosis: Murder’ as Sandra in the episode called’ No Good Deed.’ She then essayed Lila Rotundi’s character in the drama romance’ Felicity.’ In 2002, she was seen on the popular police procedural TV series ‘ NYPD Blue’ as Katie Medavoy in the episode titled’ Oedipus Wrecked.’</p><p>Despite a slew of recurring characters to her name, Kala was unable to find meatier roles and had to contend with guest appearances for the rest of her career. She made a brief appearance on the comedy drama TV series ‘ Boston Public’ in the episode ‘ Chapter Fifty-Four’ in 2003.</p><p>From 2003 to 2004, she was roped in to play Lacy’s recurring role in the popular sitcom ‘ 8 Simple Rules.’ She starred in three episodes:’ Opposites Attract: Part 2,” Merry Christmas: The Story of Anne Frank and Skeevy’ and’ Sort of an Officer and a Gentleman: Part 2.’ This remains her most prominent role to date. She wasn’t seen on TV screens for many years after working in’ 8 Simple Rules.’</p><p>She made a comeback as Vanessa in the 2007 movie’ Dead Write’ and later starred in the same year as Raven in the drama movie ‘ La Cucina.’ Her last acting credit was in the comedy series ‘ Aliens in America’ (2008), in which she played Mindy Weinblau’s role.&nbsp;Savage has taken a break from acting and is completely focused on her personal life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kala-savage-movies></span><span>Kala Savage Movies</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=filmography></span><span>Filmography</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=film></span><span>Film</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table border=1 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Title</strong></td><td><strong>Role</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>Dead Write</td><td>Vanessa</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>La Cucina</td><td>Raven</td></tr><tr><td>1989</td><td>Little Monsters</td><td>Little Monster</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=television></span><span>Television</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Role</strong></p><p>2008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aliens in America&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mindy Weinblau</p><p>2003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boston Public</p><p>2003-2004&nbsp; 8 Simple Rules&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lacey/Lacy</p><p>2002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NYPD Blue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katie Medavoy</p><p>2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That ’70s Show&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teenage Paula</p><p>2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diagnosis Murder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sandra</p><p>2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felicity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lila Rotundi</p><p>1999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undressed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gwen</p><p>1989&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Santa Barbara&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anisa</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kala-savage-net-worth></span><span>Kala Savage Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kala’s primary source of income, currently we don’t have enough information about cars, monthly / yearly salary, We will update you soon.
