Frankel uploaded a video of<a href=#> her 14-year-old daughter Bryn</a> — whom she shares with ex-husband<strong> Jason Hoppy</strong> — posing with de Lesseps.</p><p>After <a href=#>the promising interaction</a>, Frankel offered more insight into where she and de Lesseps stand now.</p><p>“So I see Luann [at the event] and Bryn gets all devious. My friend Mark is like, ‘Just say something.’ Why not, right? And it is also a good example for Bryn. We have to be good examples,” Frankel explained via <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> on Sunday, July 7. “I basically said, ‘Congratulations’ and Bryn is there which is great because she bridged my relationship with my mom.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Luann-de-Lesseps-Is-Still-Blocked-by-Bethenny-Frankel-Despite-Reconciliation-2.jpg><p>Frankel confirmed that de Lesseps <a href=#>had a sweet moment with her daughter.</a></p><p>“Luann hugged Bryn. We had to do it on social media because if it didn’t happen there then it didn’t happen anywhere,” Frankel continued. “That was nice and clean. She texted me and [wrote], ‘We are like some discombobulated family.’ So that was pleasant and fun.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Luann-de-Lesseps-Is-Still-Blocked-by-Bethenny-Frankel-Despite-Reconciliation.jpg><p>Frankel and de Lesseps <a href=#>both starred on the OG RHONY show</a>. Bravo viewers saw them face major ups and downs before mending their issues in 2019. Their feud was reignited in 2023 when de Lesseps <a href=#>didn’t show support for Frankel’s fight to unionize reality TV stars.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Now, back to Bethenny. You know, listen, why bite the hand that feeds you?” de Lesseps quipped during a December 2023 cabaret show. “You know, just go off into the sunset. You [Bethenny] make millions and gazillions of dollars. If you claim you do, then why are you still harping on us? Why are you talking about us?”</p><p>De Lesseps elaborated on their divide earlier this year, telling Us in May how <a href=#>she wasn’t interested in filming with Frankel again.</a></p><p>“Probably Bethenny, to be perfectly honest,” de Lesseps said. “I don’t think she’d come to the table in any case. … I’m not a person that lives in regrets. I think everything happens and I loved all of our fights. It was so good.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOumZ6jeqWxjKWcrKuVpcBuwMeipaSrXZeytbTEp6WyZZanrq%2B3xKVkn5mbmrFuvsSupaKnnmKzsL6MrKacoZGheq6xw6KYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kyla-pratt-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Kyla Pratt Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
