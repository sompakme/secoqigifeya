Christina filed for divorce in November 2020, two months after <a href=#>announcing her separation</a> from the Wheeler Dealers star.</p><p>“I never thought I would have one divorce let alone two. I never thought I would have 2 baby daddies – but sometimes life throws us curve balls,” she wrote via Instagram in September 2020, <a href=#>reflecting on her single woman status</a>. “Instead of getting stuck in these ‘setbacks’ I choose to look at these challenges as opportunities to grow. So while some may judge me and throw around rumors about me, most of you support me. And that says a lot about this world and where we are headed. I’m messy, I’m real and I’m working on healing. … We are all a work in progress.”</p><p>The former spouses were married for nearly two years when they called it quits. They share <a href=#>son Hudson, who was born in September 2019</a>.</p><p>Christina and Josh’s budding summer relationship also came amid news that <a href=#>Anstead had moved on with Zellweger</a> in June 2021 after meeting on the set of the Discovery+ series Celebrity IOU: Joyride.</p><p>Before Christina and Anstead got together in late 2017, the Wellness Remodel author was married to <a href=#><strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong></a> for seven years before parting ways in 2016. The exes, who finalized their divorce two years later, share <a href=#>daughter Taylor, born in 2010, and son Brayden, born in 2015</a>.</p><p>El Moussa, for his part, moved on with Selling Sunset’s <a href=#><strong>Heather Rae Young</strong></a>, whom he wed in October 2021.</p><p>Six months later, Us confirmed that the Christina: Stronger by Design star had <a href=#>quietly tied the knot again</a> after getting engaged to Josh in September 2021. Multiple outlets revealed in April 2022 that the TV personality had changed her married name to Christina Hall on her real estate license.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later that month, the designer revealed via Instagram that <a href=#>she and her new husband</a> had moved from Dana Point to Newport Beach, California, into their “long-term family home.”</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Haack’s new hubby:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKm%2ByKyroqaRYrWircKkZJ2ZpJ67qHnJqKqhrZFitaK4y2auoZmkYsGwecqnprBlkZe8tsCMoaCmZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-jericho-will-never-have-a-big-retirement-match-he-ll-just-disappear.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Jericho Will Never Have A Big Retirement Match, Hell Just Disappear</span></a>
